### Life before the storm

"When this conference is over, I'm going to wind down and focus on us. Preparing for the baby."

I had told Lay Hing this just days before our 20-week ultrasound, as we both acknowledged the unsustainable pace of our professional lives. I had been immersed in consulting work for the World Bank, culminating in a regional conference on Aruba. The appointment was scheduled for the week right after the conference concluded—perfect timing, I thought, to shift my attention toward family.

We had even discussed the gender reveal during the week leading up to the appointment. Lay Hing wanted to have the doctor write it down in an envelope so she could plan a surprise reveal. I secretly hoped to discern the gender myself by watching the ultrasound screen closely, though I kept this thought to myself.

Life felt manageable then. Busy, yes, but within familiar parameters. We had our routines, our plans, our sense of control over what came next.

### The diagnosis moment

The ultrasound room felt sterile and impersonal—just another standard medical examination space with beige walls and that unmistakable antiseptic smell. Lay Hing lay on the examination table while I positioned myself where I could see the monitor screen clearly, still thinking about gender detection.

The ultrasound began routinely enough. Then I noticed the technician repeatedly zooming in on the thorax area, going back and forth with a growing intensity that made my stomach tighten. Her movements became less methodical, more urgent.

"This is not looking good at all," she finally said, her voice measured but her concern evident. "This seems like an abnormal situation. I'm very confident this is a diaphragmatic hernia because the organs are not where they are supposed to be."

My first thought was simple: _What does this even mean?_ The words made sense individually but together felt like a foreign language. I glanced at Lay Hing, who was already looking worried.

The technician excused herself to get a specialist. In no time, she returned with a doctor who quickly confirmed her assessment.

"Diaphragmatic hernia," he pronounced.

Lay Hing began crying beside me, and that's when it became real. Until that moment, I'd been processing the information rationally—_this is not good_—like analyzing data for a consulting report. But the sound of her crying transformed abstract medical terminology into visceral human pain. This wasn't just unfavorable probabilities; this was a defining moment of suffering. I could feel her pain as a mother, the special vulnerability of carrying another life inside you and suddenly being told something was terribly wrong.

The doctor explained that we would need a follow-up ultrasound soon, but the implications were serious. The baby's diaphragm hadn't formed properly, allowing abdominal organs to migrate into the chest cavity where they would compress the developing lungs. Without treatment, our son wouldn't be able to breathe after birth.

We left the clinic in a daze, the gender reveal envelope forgotten in Lay Hing's purse. None of that mattered anymore.

### The fight for Rotterdam

In the days that followed, I became consumed with research. Diaphragmatic hernia. Survival rates. Treatment protocols. The statistics were grim but not hopeless—if we could get to the right medical center with specialized expertise.

Rotterdam's Erasmus MC kept appearing in my searches. They had one of Europe's most advanced fetal surgery programs, with a specialized procedure called FETO (Fetal Endoscopic Tracheal Occlusion) that could potentially help the baby's lungs develop before birth. But getting there from Aruba meant navigating a maze of bureaucratic barriers, insurance complications, and medical logistics.

The urgency was compounded by Aruba's limited medical infrastructure. Our island had a competent hospital, but nothing like the specialized care needed for a case this complex. We would need to leave—not for a brief medical trip, but potentially for months of treatment and monitoring.

In those desperate early days, I found an unexpected lifeline: Platform CHD (Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia), where parents shared information and experiences navigating this rare condition. The president of the platform arranged a call with us—a conversation that proved invaluable. He explained the referral process through official medical channels, what questions to ask our doctors, what to expect from different treatment centers. He emphasized that the Dutch expertise centers—Rotterdam's Erasmus MC and Radboud—were among the best in the world for CDH cases, with routine access to ECMO machines and teams experienced in these complex situations.

For the first time since the diagnosis, I felt like I had some map, however incomplete, of the territory ahead.

Our health insurer's response came quickly: "Yes, you'll be sent abroad for treatment—to Bucaramanga, Colombia, where we have a contract with a hospital. We'll arrange the timing. There's no rush."

No rush. As if our son's lungs had all the time in the world to develop properly.

Armed with the information from Platform CHD, I challenged this plan. Rotterdam had superior expertise for CDH cases, state-of-the-art facilities, and crucially, would allow us to bring Amelie so she could continue school. In Colombia, keeping our family together wouldn't be possible. We would leave for Rotterdam in December, with Lay Hing at 26 weeks pregnant. Our daughter Amelie, then eight years old, would come with us. We'd leave our lives in Aruba—my consulting work, our home, Amelie's school, everything familiar—for however long it took.

### The wave mechanics of crisis

What I didn't fully understand then was how crisis propagates through interconnected systems. The initial shock—the diagnosis—was just the beginning. Each subsequent impact rippled outward, creating cascading effects we hadn't anticipated.

In my research on Small Island Developing States, I'd studied how external economic shocks transmit through tourism-dependent economies. A hurricane doesn't just damage hotels; it triggers cancellations that affect restaurants, tour operators, taxi drivers, craft vendors. The impact amplifies as it moves through the network of dependencies.

Our family crisis followed similar mechanics. The diagnosis affected not just our son's medical care, but Amelie's education and emotional stability as we prepared to uproot her life. Our financial situation faced sudden uncertainty—how long would we be gone? What would happen to my consulting work? Our relationships with extended family shifted as we leaned on them in ways we never had before. The stress placed our marriage under a pressure it had never experienced. Even our sense of who we were and what our future looked like had to be completely reimagined.

How do you maintain your identity when everything that defined it—your work, your home, your daily routines—suddenly vanishes?

Like the queen conch sensing a predator's approach through water vibrations, we could feel the threat but couldn't yet see its full dimensions. The shell's remarkable three-tiered structure can absorb tremendous impact from direct attacks, but it offers no protection against the slow, systemic threats of warming waters or changing ecosystems.

We were about to learn that some threats can't be stopped by defensive measures alone.

### Rapid response systems

The logistics of relocating a family across an ocean with a high-risk pregnancy required coordination that would have seemed impossible just weeks earlier. Yet somehow, systems aligned.

The health insurance arranged temporary housing—a hotel within walking distance of the Erasmus Medical Center. My mother reached out to family members already living in the Netherlands, mapping a network of support we might need. Clients I'd been working with responded with unexpected grace—some delayed projects without question, others informally granted leave from research commitments. In those gestures, I glimpsed something I'd forgotten in my professional drive: that business relationships, at their best, remain fundamentally human.

When hurricanes threaten island communities, neighbors don't wait for official instructions—they board up windows, move vulnerable people to shelter, share resources. I'd studied these informal networks academically. Now I was experiencing their power firsthand. Friends and family mobilized with a speed that formal institutions could never match.

But what does it mean to accept help when you've built your identity on self-reliance? When every instinct says you should be the one offering support, not receiving it? The conch's shell can handle sudden impacts remarkably well, absorbing force through its layered structure. But maintaining that shell requires constant metabolic energy—resources diverted from growth and reproduction to protection and repair. Under normal conditions, this trade-off works. Under sustained stress, something has to give.

Were we building short-term resilience at the expense of long-term sustainability? It was a question I couldn't answer yet. I only knew that we had no choice but to accept the help being offered.

### The journey to Rotterdam

January 7th, 2023. We boarded the flight to Amsterdam with Amelie holding her mother's hand and Lay Hing's belly prominently visible at 26 weeks. I carried too much luggage and too little certainty about what we were flying toward.

The flight stretched endlessly. Lay Hing couldn't find a position that eased the pressure on her back. I kept reviewing medical documents on my laptop, as if studying them one more time might reveal something I'd missed, some detail that would make what lay ahead less frightening.

Amelie was brave throughout. Eight years old, leaving behind her school, her friends, everything familiar—yet she held her composure with a strength that humbled me. What must it be like to be a child watching your parents prepare for something they can barely explain, something that fills them with obvious fear?

Landing in Amsterdam felt surreal. It was winter—something Amelie had never experienced. The cold hit us immediately as we exited the terminal, sharp and unforgiving. Her eyes went wide at her first sight of breath forming clouds in the air, a small wonder in the midst of our upheaval.

Rotterdam was an hour's drive south. As we navigated through the Dutch winter landscape, I felt the full weight of what we'd done. We had left everything familiar, crossed an ocean, and placed our trust in a medical system we knew only from research and desperate phone calls.

The Erasmus Medical Center loomed before us—a massive complex of modern buildings where our son's fate would be determined. We checked into the hotel the health insurance had arranged, just a short walk from the hospital. Close enough that we could reach the medical center quickly if needed. Close enough that we'd never really escape its presence.

That first night, lying in an unfamiliar bed in a city I'd once known as a student but now barely recognized, I realized something fundamental had shifted. We had willingly surrendered our shells—the comfortable protective structures of our Aruban life—for the chance to save our son.

Whether we could build new ones in Rotterdam, or whether we'd need to develop entirely different forms of resilience, remained to be seen.

The wave had hit. Now we would discover what we were actually made of.
