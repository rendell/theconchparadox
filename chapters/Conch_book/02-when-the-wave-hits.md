## Chapter 2: When the Wave Hits
"When this conference is over, I'm going to wind down and focus on us. Preparing for the baby."

I had told Lay Hing this just days before our 20-week ultrasound, as we both acknowledged the unsustainable pace of our professional lives. I had been immersed in consulting work for the World Bank, culminating in a regional conference on Aruba. The appointment was scheduled for the week after the conference concluded—perfect timing, I thought, to shift my attention toward family.

We had discussed the gender reveal during the week leading up to the appointment. Lay Hing wanted the doctor to write it down in an envelope so she could plan a surprise. I secretly hoped to discern the gender myself by watching the ultrasound screen closely, though I kept this thought to myself.

Life felt manageable then. Busy, yes, but within familiar parameters. We had our routines, our plans, our sense of control over what came next.

### The diagnosis

The ultrasound room felt sterile and impersonal—beige walls, antiseptic smell, just another standard examination space. Lay Hing lay on the table while I positioned myself where I could see the monitor, still thinking about gender detection.

Then I noticed the technician repeatedly zooming in on the thorax area, going back and forth with growing intensity. Her movements became less methodical, more urgent.

"This is not looking good at all," she finally said. "This seems like an abnormal situation. I'm very confident this is a diaphragmatic hernia because the organs are not where they are supposed to be."

My first thought was simple: _What does this even mean?_ The words made sense individually but together felt like a foreign language.

The technician excused herself to get a specialist. She returned with a doctor who quickly confirmed her assessment.

"Diaphragmatic hernia."

Lay Hing began crying beside me, and that's when it became real. Until that moment, I'd been processing information rationally—_this is not good_—like analyzing data for a report. But the sound of her crying transformed abstract terminology into visceral human pain. This wasn't unfavorable probabilities; this was suffering. I could feel her pain as a mother, the vulnerability of carrying another life inside you and suddenly being told something was terribly wrong.

The doctor explained that we would need a follow-up ultrasound, but the implications were serious. The baby's diaphragm hadn't formed properly, allowing abdominal organs to migrate into the chest cavity where they would compress the developing lungs. Without treatment, our son wouldn't be able to breathe after birth.

We left the clinic in a daze. The gender reveal envelope sat forgotten in Lay Hing's purse.

### The fight for Rotterdam

In the days that followed, I became consumed with research. Diaphragmatic hernia. Survival rates. Treatment protocols. The statistics were grim but not hopeless—if we could get to the right medical center.

Rotterdam's Erasmus MC kept appearing in my searches. They had one of Europe's most advanced fetal surgery programs, with a specialized procedure called FETO that could potentially help the baby's lungs develop before birth. But getting there from Aruba meant navigating bureaucratic barriers, insurance complications, and medical logistics that seemed designed to slow everything down.

The urgency was compounded by Aruba's limited infrastructure. Our island had a competent hospital, but nothing like the specialized care this case required. We would need to leave—not for a brief medical trip, but potentially for months.

In those desperate early days, I found an unexpected lifeline: Platform CHD, where parents shared information and experiences navigating this rare condition. The president arranged a call with us—a conversation that proved invaluable. He explained the referral process, what questions to ask, what to expect from different treatment centers. He emphasized that the Dutch expertise centers were among the best in the world for CDH cases, with routine access to ECMO machines and experienced teams.

For the first time since the diagnosis, I felt like I had some map of the territory ahead.

Our health insurer's response came quickly: "Yes, you'll be sent abroad for treatment—to Bucaramanga, Colombia, where we have a contract. We'll arrange the timing. There's no rush."

_No rush._ As if our son's lungs had all the time in the world.

Armed with information from Platform CHD, I challenged this plan. Rotterdam had superior expertise, state-of-the-art facilities, and crucially, would allow us to bring Amelie so she could continue school. In Colombia, keeping our family together wouldn't be possible.

The insurer relented. We would leave for Rotterdam in early January, with Lay Hing at 26 weeks pregnant. Amelie, eight years old, would come with us. We'd leave our lives in Aruba—my consulting work, our home, her school, everything familiar—for however long it took.

### The journey

January 7th. We boarded the flight to Amsterdam with Amelie holding her mother's hand and Lay Hing's belly visible at 26 weeks. I carried too much luggage and too little certainty about what we were flying toward.

The flight stretched endlessly. Lay Hing couldn't find a position that eased the pressure on her back. I kept reviewing medical documents on my laptop, as if studying them again might reveal something I'd missed.

Amelie was brave throughout. Eight years old, leaving behind her school, her friends, everything familiar—yet she held her composure with a strength that humbled me. I wondered what it must be like to be a child watching your parents prepare for something they can barely explain, something that fills them with obvious fear.

Landing in Amsterdam felt surreal. It was winter—something Amelie had never experienced. The cold hit us immediately as we exited the terminal, sharp and unforgiving. Her eyes went wide at her first sight of breath forming clouds in the air, a small wonder amid the upheaval.

Rotterdam was an hour's drive south. As we navigated through the Dutch winter landscape, I felt the full weight of what we'd done. We had left everything familiar, crossed an ocean, placed our trust in a medical system we knew only from research and desperate phone calls.

### First night

The Erasmus Medical Center loomed before us—a massive complex of modern buildings where our son's fate would be determined. We checked into the hotel the insurance had arranged, just a short walk from the hospital. Close enough to reach quickly if needed. Close enough that we'd never really escape its presence.

That first night, lying in an unfamiliar bed in a city I'd once known as a student but now barely recognized, I thought about how quickly everything had changed. Three weeks earlier, I'd been planning a gender reveal. Now I was calculating survival percentages and learning medical terminology I'd never wanted to know.

We had willingly left behind the protective structures of our Aruban life—the routines, the familiarity, the sense of control—for the chance to save our son. Whether we could build new structures here, or whether we'd need to develop entirely different capacities, remained to be seen.

What I couldn't know yet was how the very systems designed to save him would create dependencies we'd struggle to escape. Or how the expertise that gave us hope would simultaneously constrain our choices in ways we couldn't anticipate.

But that night, none of that mattered. We were in Rotterdam. The medical team was ready. And somewhere in the uncertainty ahead, our son was fighting to develop lungs that might let him breathe.
