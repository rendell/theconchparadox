**The theoretical constellation you're connecting to**

Your professor was almost certainly referring to the **Lipsey-Lancaster General Theory of Second Best** (1956), which is one of the most important results in welfare economics. The core insight is devastating to additive policy logic:

> "If there is introduced into a general equilibrium system a constraint which prevents the attainment of one of the Paretian conditions, the other Paretian conditions, although still attainable, are, in general, no longer desirable."

Translation: In a world with multiple distortions, fixing one distortion doesn't necessarily improve things—it might make them worse. You cannot assume that moving closer to the "ideal" on one dimension improves the overall outcome. The ceteris paribus assumption that "improving X while holding everything else equal improves the system" simply doesn't hold in complex, interconnected systems.

**Rodrik's modern application**

Dani Rodrik has become the most prominent contemporary voice extending this to development policy. His key arguments directly support your framework:

1. **Second-best institutions**: "Best practice" institutional reforms often fail because they ignore context-specific constraints that can't be removed quickly. The right policy depends on the full constellation of existing distortions—not some universal template.
2. **The Washington Consensus critique**: The IMF/World Bank approach assumed you could attack distortions sequentially and additively. Rodrik showed this was "based on a first-best model of the economy" that doesn't match reality. "There are many more distortions and there is never the capacity to attack them all at once."
3. **The forgotten principle**: In a recent interview, Rodrik stated bluntly: "The main thing we forgot was that economics is the science of trade-offs... This brings us to the second forgotten economic principle: the principle of second-best. The world is necessarily second-best, and our policy objectives are not as neatly separable as first-best economists assumed."

**Related concepts that strengthen your argument**

**Goodhart's Law** (1975): "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure." The moment you optimize for a specific resilience indicator, you change behavior in ways that undermine the indicator's validity. The World Bank's A/B/C resilience rating system is a perfect example of something vulnerable to this.

**Campbell's Law**: "The more any quantitative social indicator is used for social decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures and the more apt it will be to distort and corrupt the social processes it is intended to monitor."

**The Lucas Critique** (1976): Economic relationships that held historically will break down once policymakers try to exploit them—because people adapt their behavior to the new policy environment.

**How this connects to the conch paradox**

Your paradox is essentially the _ecological/evolutionary_ version of second-best theory. Where Lipsey-Lancaster said "fixing one distortion in a system of distortions doesn't necessarily help," you're saying "building specialized protection against one threat in an environment of multiple threats doesn't necessarily help—and may hurt."

The theoretical parallel:

|Economic Second-Best|Conch Paradox|
|---|---|
|Multiple distortions exist|Multiple threats exist|
|Fixing one may worsen others|Protecting against one may increase vulnerability to others|
|Optimal policy depends on full system|Optimal adaptation depends on full threat environment|
|Context-specificity required|No universal resilience|
|Ceteris paribus doesn't hold|Specialized adaptation creates rigidity|

**Should you devote more attention to this?**

Yes, but strategically. Here's my recommendation:

1. **Don't make it the center of the book**—the conch metaphor and personal narrative are your competitive advantage. Heavy economic theory would undercut the crossover appeal.
2. **Add a substantive section in Chapter 1 or Chapter 10** that explicitly connects the conch paradox to this theoretical tradition. Something like: "Economists have long understood this pattern in policy design—what Lipsey and Lancaster called the 'theory of second best' and Dani Rodrik applies to development reform. The conch paradox extends this insight beyond policy to the fundamental logic of adaptation itself."
3. **Use it to strengthen your critique of the World Bank approach**. Their 5 I framework assumes additive logic—more income plus more insurance plus better information equals more resilience. Second-best theory says this is exactly the kind of reasoning that fails in complex systems. You have Nobel-adjacent theoretical backing for your critique.
4. **Reference Rodrik's latest book** (coming 2025): _Shared Prosperity in a Fractured World_ explicitly argues for "second-best decision making" over first-best idealism. Positioning yourself alongside his current thinking would be powerful.
5. **Consider Goodhart's Law as an accessible entry point**. It's more intuitive than Lipsey-Lancaster and readers will recognize it: "When resilience becomes a target, it ceases to be resilience." That's essentially what you're arguing about the "resilience industrial complex."

**A paragraph you might use**

> Economists have known this for decades. In 1956, Richard Lipsey and Kelvin Lancaster proved what they called the "general theory of second best": in a world with multiple imperfections, fixing one imperfection doesn't necessarily improve outcomes—it might make them worse. Dani Rodrik has spent his career demonstrating how this principle undermines development policy that assumes reforms can be stacked like building blocks. The conch paradox extends this logic beyond policy to adaptation itself. Just as removing one economic distortion can amplify others, building protection against one threat can create vulnerability to others. There is no universal path to resilience because every protective adaptation reshapes the threat landscape it was designed to address.

This gives you theoretical grounding without turning the book into an economics treatise. It signals to academic readers that you know the literature while keeping the narrative accessible.
