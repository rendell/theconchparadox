## The gravitational pull of the familiar

Three years have passed since we returned to Aruba with Neo healthy but forever changed by his early struggles. He now plays freely on our beach, building sandcastles and splashing in the turquoise water with the uninhibited joy of a child who has no memory of fighting for breath in a Rotterdam hospital room. Watching him, I'm struck by how completely he has claimed this island as his home, despite spending his first critical months in a world of machines and monitors thousands of miles away.

Yet if I'm honest, our family's transformation has proven more fragile than I expected during those intense months when crisis stripped away everything except what mattered most.

Lay had seen it coming. The night we passed the fit-to-fly test, while I was practically bouncing around our Rotterdam apartment imagining walking barefoot in our yard, she had asked quietly: "What if we go back and fall into the same old patterns?"

I dismissed her concern with the confidence of someone who believed crisis automatically creates transformation. "We're changed people now," I told her. "We've been through too much together to go backwards."

She wasn't convinced. She kept returning to this theme over our final weeks in Rotterdam—mixed feelings about a return that should have been purely joyful. Something nagged at me too, if I'm honest. The crisis had unified us against external threats, but had it really resolved the underlying tensions about priorities, communication, and partnership that had existed before Neo's medical emergency?

I chose to focus on the practical excitement of going home rather than engaging with her deeper concerns. That choice, in retrospect, was the first sign that I was already beginning to retreat from the emotional work our relationship required.

## Wasting a good crisis

"Never waste a good crisis," the saying goes. But we did exactly that.

We returned to Aruba transformed by our medical ordeal—more grateful, more aware of what really mattered, more committed to putting family first. For a few months, the heightened perspective lasted. We spent quality time together. We prioritized the children. We made decisions collectively. The solidarity that had carried us through Rotterdam felt like it would be our new foundation.

Then, gradually, the old patterns reasserted themselves with disappointing inevitability. The work demands returned. The competing priorities resurfaced. The underlying tensions about time allocation, decision-making, and partnership that had existed before our crisis emerged again, perhaps even stronger for having been temporarily suppressed rather than resolved.

What I failed to recognize was that surviving crisis together doesn't automatically create the foundation for ongoing partnership. Crisis response mobilizes existing capabilities against clearly defined threats. Sustainable relationship building requires different skills entirely—sustained emotional presence, patience with ambiguity, tolerance for the messy work of addressing incompatibilities that may never be fully resolved.

Lay had been right to worry. And I had been too eager to celebrate our escape to hear her.

## Building the shell

When we returned to Aruba, my first priority was restoring the children's bedrooms. Lay designed beautiful themes for each—Encanto for Amelie, space exploration for Neo—while I focused on execution. We painted walls, arranged furniture, and created spaces that would help them reclaim their sense of home after our long displacement.

Lay encouraged this focus on the children, and working together on their rooms felt like the family-first partnership we had promised each other in Rotterdam. But as soon as the children's spaces were complete, I turned my attention to a project that had been gestating in my mind throughout our final months abroad: creating the perfect home office.

Lay supported this goal enthusiastically at first. We had agreed that I deserved a proper workspace after years of making do with makeshift arrangements. She had enjoyed her own home office for years, so my desire for dedicated space felt fair and reasonable. We even paid for modifications from our company account—new paint, custom shelving, upgraded technology. Lay provided advice on the look and feel, helping me envision a space that would be both productive and comfortable.

The transformation took about two weeks of focused effort. I approached it with the same intensity I had brought to mastering medical equipment in the NICU, meticulously designing every detail for maximum efficiency and comfort. Custom shelves housed my entire book collection. A small refrigerator meant I never had to leave for refreshments. A large television screen enabled video conferences and data visualization. The walls displayed my Rotterdam paintings, including the conch shell piece that held pride of place directly across from my desk.

What had begun as a shared project to create functional workspace gradually became something else entirely: my personal sanctuary, designed according to my preferences, organized for my needs, and increasingly essential to my daily emotional regulation.

## The visual irony

The office layout created an unintentional tableau that would prove prophetic. The conch painting hung prominently on the wall directly facing my desk—impossible to miss during the long hours I spent there. When Lay would open the door to attempt conversation, she would stand right next to the painting, creating a visual frame that juxtaposed her frustrated presence with the image I had created of protective shell-building.

I never consciously noticed this positioning during those early months. The painting had simply found its natural place in my carefully curated environment, a reminder of the intellectual insights I had gained during our Rotterdam journey. But the irony was building, even if I couldn't see it yet.

Amelie, meanwhile, developed her own relationship with my office retreat. She would walk right in without hesitation, asking for help with homework, requesting playtime, or simply wanting to share something exciting from her day. Her interruptions were always welcome—perhaps because she approached my space with the innocence of someone who didn't yet understand that adults sometimes hide from each other.

"Daddy's in his shell again," she might say, though I'm not sure she recognized the full meaning of her metaphor. Amelie seemed to instinctively understand that getting me "out of my shell" was sometimes necessary, and she possessed the confidence to breach boundaries that Lay increasingly felt were designed to exclude her.

## When retreat becomes routine

The return to work overload happened gradually, then suddenly. Despite our Rotterdam promises to prioritize family, both Lay and I found it difficult to say no to projects that offered financial security after our lean year abroad. Lay especially felt pressure to accept every opportunity, given how much we had lived on Cornerstone's reserves during our medical crisis with minimal activity.

Before long, we were competing again for time and space to work, despite having agreed repeatedly in Rotterdam that family would come first. The familiar patterns reasserted themselves with disappointing inevitability: overlapping deadlines, competing priorities, and the stress of managing both business partnership and marriage simultaneously.

When tensions arose around work allocation or household responsibilities, I found myself falling back on a script that felt protective but proved destructive: "This isn't going anywhere. I'm going to my office to work."

The phrase became my exit strategy from difficult conversations. Rather than engaging with Lay's concerns about our relationship patterns, rather than sitting with the discomfort of conflicts that had no clear solutions, I would retreat to the one space where I maintained complete control. The office door became a physical barrier to emotional availability.

Sometimes I would even lock it—not consciously trying to exclude Lay, but creating an environment where I could focus without interruption. From my perspective, I was protecting my productivity and mental space. From her perspective, I was choosing work over relationship, using my perfect sanctuary as a fortress against emotional intimacy.

The more beautiful and comfortable I made the office, the more time I wanted to spend there. It became my preferred environment—a place where everything was organized according to my preferences, where I could engage with intellectually stimulating challenges rather than emotionally complex relationship dynamics, where I felt competent and in control rather than uncertain and vulnerable.

## The hidden ledger of trauma

What I didn't fully appreciate during this period was that Lay carried her own heavy burdens—traumas from her past that our medical crisis had temporarily set aside but never truly resolved. The separation she had experienced before we met, involving her first child. The patterns she had developed for self-protection. The ways she had learned to manage pain and disappointment.

My own coping mechanisms, though perhaps less dramatic, were equally well-established. The standoffishness. The retreat into intellectual analysis when emotions became too intense. The difficulty letting someone fully in, even someone I loved. These patterns had served me in certain contexts—they enabled the analytical detachment necessary for economic research, the professional boundaries that protected me from burnout, the independence that allowed me to work effectively under pressure.

But in marriage, the very patterns that had served me became barriers. Lay needed to talk through problems, to process feelings, to work toward mutual understanding through sustained conversation. I increasingly preferred to analyze situations privately and emerge with proposed solutions rather than engage in what felt like circular discussions that escalated tensions without reaching resolution.

"You're cold," Lay would say during our increasingly frequent conflicts. "It's like you don't care."

From her perspective, my emotional distance felt like rejection. My retreat to analytical problem-solving looked like avoidance of genuine engagement. My preference for independent decision-making seemed like dismissal of her input and perspective.

From my perspective, I was managing stress the only way I knew how—by creating protected space for focused thinking, by avoiding conversations that seemed to generate heat without light, by making decisions that kept our household and business functioning even when partnership consensus proved elusive.

Neither of us was entirely wrong. Both of us were trapped in patterns that had deep roots, patterns that our medical crisis had temporarily overridden but never fundamentally changed.

## When resilience runs out

The mediation paperwork sits on my desk, each form a stark reminder of how the solidarity that carried us through Neo's medical emergency has given way to something I never anticipated: the recognition that weathering an external crisis together doesn't automatically create the foundation for ongoing partnership.

I pick up the intake questionnaire, designed to help the mediator understand our relationship patterns. One question stops me: "What behaviors or communication patterns contribute to conflict in your relationship?"

I stare at the form, pen hovering over the blank space, and find myself unable to write. The answer feels both obvious and impossible to articulate. How do I explain that the very capabilities that made me effective during crisis—analytical thinking, independent decision-making, emotional compartmentalization—have become liabilities in the ongoing work of building sustainable partnership?

The afternoon light slants through the window, catching dust motes suspended in the air. My office is quiet. The air conditioning hums its familiar drone. Outside, I can hear Neo laughing somewhere in the yard—that sound still feels like a miracle, three years after we weren't sure he'd survive.

My eyes drift from the form to the wall across from my desk.

The conch painting.

I've looked at it a thousand times since hanging it there. I created it during our darkest Rotterdam days, working on it during breaks from Neo's care—a way of processing the insights I was gaining about resilience paradoxes. The three-layered shell structure I found so fascinating. The remarkable protective architecture that had inspired my research. The beautiful spiral that had survived millions of years by perfecting its defenses against known threats.

But right now, in this moment, with the mediation form asking me to explain my "behaviors and communication patterns," something shifts.

I'm not looking at a painting anymore. I'm looking at a mirror.

## The recognition

It doesn't arrive as thought. It arrives as sensation—a cold clarity spreading through my chest, the kind of physical recognition that precedes understanding.

_I am the conch._

The words form slowly, almost against my will.

_This office is my shell._

I look around the room I've made so comfortable, so perfectly suited to my needs. The custom shelving holding my entire book collection. The small refrigerator so I never have to leave. The large screen for video conferences and data visualization. Everything optimized. Everything under control. Everything designed so I can retreat here and seal the entrance.

My throat tightens.

For years, I've been studying how specialized protection creates new vulnerabilities. I've written academic papers about it. I've advised the World Bank on it. I've painted this very shell as a reminder of the paradox.

And I've been living inside my own version without seeing it.

I think about the conch's sealing behavior—how the instinct that protects against sharks guarantees capture by fishermen.

I think about all the times I've said those words: 'This isn't going anywhere. I'm going to my office.

My exit strategy from difficult conversations. My way of sealing the entrance when I felt threatened by conflict, by emotion, by the messiness of intimacy that doesn't resolve into clean solutions.

My protective mechanism.

The door opens.

Lay stands in the doorway, and for the first time I notice where she's standing—right next to the painting. The visual frame is almost too perfect: my wife, frustrated and wanting connection, positioned beside the image of the shell I've been unconsciously replicating in my behavior for years.

"You're in here again," she says. Not quite an accusation. More like confirmation of something she's known longer than I have.

I look at her. I look at the painting beside her. I look at the mediation form in my hands.

"I know," I say. And for the first time, I actually do.

## The cruelest irony

That visual frame—Lay standing beside the conch painting—would become seared into my memory. It captured everything I had failed to see.

The painting had been hanging there for months, directly in my line of sight every day I worked. I had created it as an intellectual exercise, a way of processing the insights I was gaining about resilience and vulnerability. It was supposed to be about island economies. About institutions. About systems.

It had never occurred to me that it was also about me.

This is perhaps the cruelest dimension of the paradox: we can study our own patterns without recognizing them. We can articulate precisely the mechanism by which protection becomes constraint, and still live inside that constraint without seeing it.

The conch paradox, I realize, isn't a problem to be solved but a tension to be managed. Both protection and adaptation serve essential functions. The challenge lies not in choosing one over the other but in developing the wisdom to know when each serves us and when each constrains us.

Lay's words from Rotterdam echo in my mind: "What if we go back and fall into the same old patterns?"

We did. I did.

## Writing through the revelation

The moment I recognized the pattern, I did what had become instinctive during our Rotterdam journey: I opened my laptop and started writing. Not because I had answers—I didn't. But because clarity, even painful clarity, felt like something worth capturing before it could slip away into rationalization or denial.

For months I had struggled with how to end this book. Was a story about resilience supposed to have a happy ending? I wasn't feeling happy. The marriage I had fought to protect during our medical crisis was now requiring a different kind of fight entirely—one where my usual weapons of analysis and determination seemed useless, perhaps even counterproductive.

But sitting there with the mediation paperwork and the conch painting staring back at me, I realized something important: this book was never meant to be a success story. I wasn't writing it as a representation of how good I am, how I had overcome adversity and emerged triumphant. The vulnerability I had practiced throughout these pages—about fear and uncertainty, about feeling inadequate, about the messy reality of crisis—that same vulnerability demanded honesty about where I was now.

The journey doesn't end with resolution. Sometimes it ends with recognition. And perhaps that's enough.

## The conversations that followed

Months later, when Lay and I were on speaking terms and conversations about the book weren't as charged, she asked me directly: "Don't you think it's a bit ironic that you're writing about resilience but you're not living it through your marriage?"

The question landed with the precision of someone who knew exactly where my defenses were weakest. She had read the introduction and first chapter. She could see the disconnect between the insights on the page and the patterns in our home.

"I'm not writing this as a success story," I told her. "I want to be vulnerable. I want to show the journey—including the parts where I don't have answers. I hope readers will appreciate the honesty more than they would appreciate a neat resolution I haven't earned."

What I couldn't articulate then, but understand better now, is that the book and the marriage were teaching me the same lesson from different angles. Both required me to stop retreating into the comfort of analysis and start doing the harder work of presence.

## Breaking the pattern

In one of our mediation sessions, Lay shared something that stopped me cold: "I've realized I was making the success of Cornerstone Economics synonymous with the success of _us_ as partners. When you would retreat or not offer the helping hand I needed, I interpreted it as you not caring about me. Your passions—including writing this book—felt like they were replacing me."

The mediator flagged this as a significant revelation. And I knew I couldn't let her vulnerability stand alone.

"I recognize that I've been retreating into my shell," I said. "My coping mechanism made me seem indifferent. But I was trying to create a safe environment for myself, and in doing so, I wasn't letting you in."

The words felt inadequate against the weight of years of accumulated distance. But they were true, and sometimes truth is the only foundation worth building on.

In later sessions, Lay discovered a concept that transformed her approach: _Let them._ She keeps returning to that phrase—how it's not about letting go, but about giving space. Not pushing her anxiety-driven need to be heard in ways that only made me retreat further. She describes it as transformative, and I can see the change in how she approaches our difficult conversations.

For my part, I've become acutely conscious of my patterns. When I find myself in my office, I look at that conch painting and ask myself: _Am I doing it again?_ Sometimes the answer is yes. And in those moments, I force myself to leave. To go downstairs. To be present even when presence feels uncomfortable.

The painting has become a different kind of reminder now. Not of intellectual insight, but of who I used to be—and who I'm trying not to remain.

## The nail in the forehead

But recognizing patterns and changing them are different things entirely. The mediator showed me a video that crystallized something I had been doing wrong for years.

In it, a woman complains to her partner about the pain of having a nail embedded in her forehead. Her partner, seeing the obvious problem, keeps trying to suggest removing the nail. She grows increasingly frustrated: "You're not listening to me!"

The point isn't subtle, but it landed hard. My entire approach to Lay's concerns had been to identify the nail and propose solutions. Efficient. Logical. And completely counterproductive.

I do my best now to listen. To ask questions. To resist the overwhelming urge to fix what I see. It's harder than any analytical challenge I've faced in my research—because my instinct to solve problems is precisely the pattern I'm trying to break.

But I'm learning that sometimes the most resilient response isn't to build better defenses or devise better strategies. It's to simply be present with someone else's pain without trying to make it go away.

## Grace

"You must have grace with her," my mediator told me during one of our sessions.

Grace. Not a word I use often in my economic research. Not a concept that appears in resilience frameworks or adaptive capacity assessments. But perhaps it should.

When I think about the Small Island Developing States I study—their policy failures, their governance challenges, their seemingly irrational attachment to economic structures that no longer serve them—I find myself feeling something new. Not judgment, but understanding. Not frustration, but compassion.

It's easy to become critical: if only we had better politicians with clearer priorities. If only the private sector cared about the common good. If only people would make the obvious changes that would improve their outcomes.

But it's not so simple. Everyone operates within environments shaped by incentives they didn't choose, histories they inherited, and protective patterns that once made sense. The conch didn't choose to grow a shell that would become a liability—it was responding to the conditions of its existence. And when those conditions changed faster than evolution could accommodate, the very adaptations that ensured survival became threats to it.

The same grace I'm learning to extend to Lay—patience with her patterns, understanding of her fears, acceptance that change takes time—is the grace I must extend to the islands I study. And perhaps to myself.

## Living the question

I don't know how this story ends. As I write these words, Lay and I are still in the process of rebuilding—or perhaps building something new entirely. The mediation sessions have become less frequent. We know what needs to be done. The painful work now is extending grace to each other, practicing patience, and staying committed to better habits on both sides.

It's scary. There are no guarantees. The same uncertainty that characterized Neo's early months in Rotterdam has returned in a different form—not life-threatening, but life-shaping nonetheless.

What I've learned is that resilience isn't about reaching a destination where challenges no longer exist. It's about developing the capacity to remain present through ongoing transformation. The conch paradox isn't a problem to be solved but a tension to be navigated—knowing when protection serves growth and when it constrains it, when to retreat and when to emerge, when to analyze and when to simply feel.

Breaking any pattern requires a hard decision: that the benefit of change far outweighs the pain of moving out of your comfort zone. It's hard. It's painful. But it's necessary.

The painting still hangs in my office. I see it every day. But its meaning has shifted. It no longer represents an intellectual insight about island economies or even a personal revelation about my own patterns. It has become an invitation—daily, persistent, uncomfortable—to ask whether I am hiding or engaging, protecting or connecting, surviving or truly living.

Some days I fail. Some days the old patterns reassert themselves with familiar ease. But increasingly, I catch myself. I look at the shell and remember that the organism inside has the capacity to emerge.

That emergence—tentative, ongoing, never complete—is what resilience actually looks like. Not bouncing back to what was, but moving forward into what might be.

## For the reader

If you've followed this journey through Rotterdam hospitals and Aruban homecomings, through economic theory and family crisis, through the metaphor of a Caribbean mollusk and the reality of a marriage under strain—I hope you've recognized something of yourself along the way.

We all build shells. We all develop protective mechanisms that serve us well until conditions change. We all face moments when the very adaptations that ensured our survival begin to constrain our growth.

Your shell might look nothing like mine. Perhaps it's professional busyness that protects against intimacy. Perfectionism that shields against vulnerability. Financial control that buffers uncertainty. Social performance that masks authentic needs. Intellectual analysis that distances from emotion.

The question isn't whether you have a shell. The question is whether you can see it clearly—and whether you're willing to do the uncomfortable work of emerging when emergence is what the moment requires.

I don't have a formula for you. I'm still figuring it out myself. But I believe the recognition is the beginning. And I believe that grace—for others and for ourselves—is what makes the ongoing work possible.

The answers were hanging on my wall for months before I could see them. Perhaps yours are equally close, waiting only for the right question to bring them into focus.

What protective shell have you built? What was it designed to protect you from? And is it still serving you—or has it become a constraint you're afraid to examine?

The conch can't ask these questions. We can.

And that capacity for conscious examination—for choosing when to protect and when to emerge, for extending grace in the midst of difficulty, for remaining present even when presence is painful—may be the truest form of resilience we possess.
