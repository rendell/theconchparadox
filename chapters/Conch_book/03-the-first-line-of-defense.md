Our first time entering the Erasmus Medical Center felt like crossing a threshold into a world where our son's fate would be decided by forces beyond our understanding.

Suyin, a close friend of Lay's, happened to be staying at the same hotel—her boyfriend was recovering from heart surgery at Erasmus. When she offered to accompany us and watch Amelie during the appointment, it felt like another small grace appearing exactly when needed.

The hospital lobby was vast and bright. And there, in the center of this medical complex where life and death decisions happened every day, someone sat at a grand piano playing "Comptine d'un Autre Été."

Amélie's song.

We had named our daughter after the character from the film, and this piece from Yann Tiersen's soundtrack had become woven into our family's story. Hearing it now, in this place, at this moment—it felt impossible to dismiss as coincidence.

I walked over to the pianist, a young man playing casually, perhaps on his break. "My daughter's name is Amelie," I told him, probably with more enthusiasm than the situation warranted. "This song is very special to us."

He looked slightly startled—Dutch people have this quality of being _nuchter_, grounded, not given to emotional displays. I could see him trying to process why this stranger was so moved by his idle playing. But I didn't care if he thought I was strange. In that moment, I chose to receive it as what it felt like: a sign that we were in the right place.

"That's Amelie's song!" Lay and I said to each other. It felt like permission to hope.

### The three paths

After navigating the labyrinthine route to the gynecology department—through a dark parking garage with painted zebra crossings guiding each turn—we finally sat in an ordinary waiting room that didn't match the magnitude of why we were there.

The gynecologist greeted us warmly. His intake was thorough, more comprehensive than anything we'd experienced in Aruba. During the ultrasound, he noted that the baby seemed to have long legs. I remember feeling oddly pleased by this observation—a glimpse of our son as a real person with physical characteristics, not just a medical case.

Then he explained our options.

**First:** Do nothing. Let the pregnancy proceed naturally, hope the baby's lungs developed enough on their own. No intervention, but also no increased risk of premature labor.

**Second:** FETO procedure at Erasmus. They would place a balloon in the baby's trachea to help the lungs develop, then remove it through a second operation. From that point forward, Lay would need strict bed rest near the hospital—any premature labor would almost certainly mean the baby wouldn't survive.

**Third:** The experimental version in Leuven, Belgium. A magnetic balloon that could be popped remotely, avoiding a second surgery. But this meant moving immediately and staying there until birth.

Then he added something that wouldn't fully register until later: because of measurement error in Aruba, we'd arrived later than optimal. Dutch patients typically had FETO around week 28. We were at week 30. The benefit-to-risk ratio at this stage was unknown.

"Given the urgency," he said, "I really need a decision as soon as possible."

He had another meeting but would reserve time afterward. We had one hour.

### The cafeteria

We found Amelie playing contentedly with Suyin in the cold and headed to the hospital cafeteria. As we sat down, both looked at us expectantly.

How do you explain impossible choices to an eight-year-old? How do you convey medical complexity and statistical uncertainty and the weight of a decision that could mean life or death?

Amelie asked questions we struggled to answer—not because we didn't want to tell her, but because we barely understood ourselves. Suyin listened quietly, her presence a strange comfort. Having someone outside our family witness this moment somehow made it more real and less isolating.

We eliminated Leuven quickly. After the long journey from Aruba, after finally getting Amelie settled, uprooting everything again felt impossible. If we were going to do this, it would be here.

But should we do it at all?

The question narrowed to a binary: FETO or trust.

We worried about premature labor. We worried about irreversible consequences. We worried about robbing our son of his chance to fight on his own terms.

I looked at Lay across the table. "Listen," I said. "At the end of the day, I don't feel I'm in a position to make this call. The baby's not in my womb. He's in yours."

She was quiet. Then she brought me back to words I hadn't fully registered when the doctor spoke them.

"He said there's no wrong or right choice here," she reminded me. "He said sometimes parents feel they have to do everything in their power to help their child. But sometimes doing nothing is everything you can do."

_Sometimes doing nothing is everything you can do._

"I want to let go," Lay said quietly. "Leave it in God's hands. If our baby is meant to survive, he will. We'll give him a chance to fight on his own strength."

Relief flooded through me—immediate, overwhelming. Not because the choice removed our burden, but because it felt right in a way I couldn't articulate. In a situation defined by medical uncertainty, we were choosing surrender. Choosing trust.

We walked back to the doctor's office.

"We've decided not to do the FETO," I told him.

"Okay," he said simply. No judgment, no disappointment. Just acceptance. He seemed genuinely comfortable with whatever choice we would have made, as if he understood that these decisions belong to the people who must live with their consequences.

### The waiting

After making the decision, we faced weeks of waiting until the baby would be induced at week 38. The primary assignment was for Lay Hing to take it easy.

This period proved valuable in unexpected ways. We focused on Amelie, working to get her enrolled in school. We figured out logistics—where to stay, who would help during critical medical periods. We walked around Rotterdam together, getting to know the city while following the doctor's recommendation that Lay stay active.

Most importantly, we had time to prepare mentally. Many unanswered questions remained, but we found comfort in having made a decision we could live with.

In my professional life, I built my identity on data-driven analysis. I calculated probabilities, provided evidence-based recommendations to governments and organizations. But here, with my son's life in the balance, all my analytical tools felt useless. The data was incomplete. The stakes were absolute.

We prayed. Not formal prayers of ritual, but raw prayers of people who had reached the edge of their competence. _Please let this be right. Please protect him._

The first line of defense, we were learning, isn't always about building barriers or taking action. Sometimes it's about having the wisdom to wait and the strength to trust. True protection sometimes looks like letting go.

But making the right decision was only the beginning. The real price of protection—financial, emotional, physical—would reveal itself in ways we never anticipated.
