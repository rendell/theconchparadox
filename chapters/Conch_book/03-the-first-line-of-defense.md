### The medical crossroads

Our first time entering the Erasmus Medical Center felt like crossing a threshold into a world where our son's fate would be decided by forces beyond our understanding.

Suyin, a close friend of Lay Hing's, happened to be staying at the same hotel—her boyfriend was recovering from heart surgery at Erasmus. When she offered to accompany us and watch Amelie during the appointment, it felt like another small grace, another piece of support appearing exactly when needed.

The hospital lobby was vast and bright. And there, in the center of this medical complex where life and death decisions happened every day, someone sat at a grand piano playing "Comptine d'un Autre Été."

Amélie's song.

We had named our daughter after the character from the film _Amélie_, and this piece from Yann Tiersen's soundtrack had become woven into our family's story. Hearing it now, in this place, at this moment—it felt impossible to dismiss as coincidence.

I walked over to the pianist, a young man playing casually, perhaps on his break. "My daughter's name is Amelie," I told him, probably with more enthusiasm than the situation warranted. "This song is very special to us."

He looked slightly startled—Dutch people have this quality of being _nuchter_, grounded, not given to emotional displays. I could see him trying to process why this stranger was so moved by his idle playing. But I didn't care if he thought I was strange. In that moment, I chose to receive it as what it felt like: a sign that we were in the right place, that we weren't alone in this.

"That's Amelie's song!" Lay Hing and I said to each other. It felt like permission to hope.

After registering at the information desk, we began the labyrinthine journey to the gynecology department. The route took us through the parking garage—a strange design that I later learned was temporary due to ongoing construction. The garage was dark and cold, a stark contrast to the bright hospital interior. Painted zebra crossing lines guided each turn we needed to make, a path through darkness toward light.

Lay Hing walked slowly, her pregnant belly prominent at 26 weeks, and I matched her pace. My mind buzzed with an excitement I couldn't quite name. Not joy, exactly. More like the heightened awareness that comes when you know you're about to face something that will change everything.

Outside the gynecology building, there was a small play area. Suyin settled there with Amelie, who seemed happy despite the January cold. We walked inside to the waiting room, which looked disappointingly ordinary—just another hospital setting, nothing that matched the magnitude of why we were there.

When we were called in, the gynecologist greeted us warmly. He had been expecting us, he said, and wanted to do a complete examination before we talked. His intake was thorough—more comprehensive than anything we'd experienced in Aruba. He asked about our parents, our family medical histories, building a fuller picture than we'd anticipated.

During the ultrasound, he was mostly quiet, focused. At one point he noted that the baby seemed to have long legs. I remember feeling oddly pleased by this observation, this glimpse of our son as a real person with physical characteristics, not just a medical case with a diaphragmatic hernia.

He performed his calculations again—the head-to-lung ratio that would help determine risk levels. Then he looked up and began explaining our options.

We had three paths before us.

**First:** Do nothing. Let the pregnancy proceed naturally, hope the baby's lungs developed enough on their own. No intervention, but also no increased risk of premature labor.

**Second:** FETO procedure done the traditional way at Erasmus. They would place a balloon in the baby's trachea to help the lungs develop, then remove it later through a second operation. This would require Erasmus bringing in a specialized team from KU Leuven, as they hadn't performed this exact version here before. From the intervention forward, Lay Hing would need to stay very close to the hospital on strict bed rest—any premature labor would almost certainly mean the baby wouldn't survive.

**Third:** The experimental version of FETO in Leuven itself. The balloon would be equipped with a magnetic component, allowing them to pop it later using a large magnetic field instead of requiring a second surgery. But this would mean moving immediately to Belgium and staying there until birth.

He paused, letting us absorb this. Then he said something else that wouldn't fully register with me until later: Because of the measurement error in Aruba, we'd arrived later than optimal. Dutch patients typically had FETO around week 28. We were at week 30. The benefit-to-risk ratio of the procedure at this stage was unknown.

"Given the urgency and the fact that we're already late," he said, "I really need a decision as soon as possible."

He had another meeting scheduled but would reserve time for us afterward. We had one hour to decide.

Take an hour. Discuss the options. Come back with your choice.

### Preparing for what's to come

We found Amelie playing contentedly with Suyin in the cold, and headed to the hospital cafeteria. As we sat down with drinks and snacks, both Suyin and Amelie looked at us expectantly, wanting to know what had happened.

How do you explain impossible choices to an eight-year-old? How do you convey medical complexity and statistical uncertainty and the weight of a decision that could mean life or death for her unborn brother?

Amelie asked questions we struggled to answer—not because we didn't want to tell her, but because we barely understood ourselves. The technical details overwhelmed us; we were still processing what we'd just heard. Suyin listened quietly, her presence a strange comfort. Having someone outside our family witness this moment, hear our struggle, somehow made it more real and less isolating.

We eliminated Leuven quickly. After the long journey from Aruba to Rotterdam, after finally getting Amelie settled, the thought of uprooting everything again to move to Belgium felt impossible. We'd have to arrange new housing, find another school, consult with our insurance all over again. And for what? An experimental version of a procedure that might not even be necessary?

No. If we were going to do this, it would be here in Rotterdam.

But should we do it at all?

The question narrowed to a binary choice: FETO or trust.

We worried about the unknown probability of premature labor. We worried about the irreversible consequences of intervention. We worried about the pain of choosing action that might rob our son of his chance to fight on his own terms.

I looked at Lay Hing across the cafeteria table. "Listen," I said. "At the end of the day, I don't feel I'm in a position to make this call. The baby's not in my womb. He's in yours."

She was quiet for a moment. Then she said something that brought me back to the doctor's office, to words I hadn't fully registered when he first spoke them.

"He said there's no wrong or right choice here," Lay Hing reminded me. "He said sometimes parents feel they have to do everything in their power to help their child. But sometimes doing nothing is everything you can do."

Those words settled between us like stones dropping into still water.

Sometimes doing nothing is everything you can do.

"I want to let go," Lay Hing said quietly. "Leave it in God's hands. If our baby is meant to survive, he will. We'll give him a chance to fight on his own strength."

Relief flooded through me—immediate, overwhelming relief. Not because the choice removed our burden, but because it felt right in a way I couldn't articulate. I had total peace with it. In a situation defined by medical uncertainty and statistical probabilities, we were choosing surrender. Choosing trust. Choosing to believe that sometimes the most protective thing you can do is step back and let natural resilience work.

Time had flown by. We gathered Amelie and Suyin and walked back to the doctor's office.

"We've decided not to do the FETO," I told him.

"Okay," he said simply. His face showed no judgment, no disappointment, no relief. Just acceptance. He seemed genuinely comfortable with whatever choice we would have made, as if he understood that these decisions belong to the people who must live with their consequences.

And just like that, our first line of defense was defined: not by intervention, but by faith in the body's own wisdom.

### When Protection Requires Surrender

That night, after we'd returned to the hotel and Amelie was asleep, Lay Hing and I lay awake in the darkness, questions circling like birds that wouldn't land.

Did we make the right choice? Were we ready to live with whatever consequences followed?

In my professional life as an economist, I built my identity on data-driven decision-making. I analyzed scenarios, calculated probabilities, provided evidence-based recommendations to governments and international organizations. But here, with my son's life hanging in the balance, all my analytical tools felt useless. The data was incomplete. The probabilities were uncertain. The stakes were absolute.

We prayed. Not the formal prayers of ritual, but the raw prayers of people who have reached the edge of their own competence. _Please let this be right. Please protect him. Please help us trust when we can't see the path._

The conch's shell, I would later learn, develops in three distinct layers—each serving a specific protective function. The outer layer absorbs initial impacts. The middle layer dissipates force. The inner layer maintains structural integrity even as cracks form. This layered defense evolved over millions of years, refined through countless encounters with predators.

But what happens when the threat isn't something the shell was designed to withstand? When warming waters or changing ecosystems present challenges that no amount of armor can address?

Perhaps that's when the creature must trust something beyond its protective structures. Perhaps that's when survival requires a different kind of wisdom—the wisdom to know that not every threat can be defended against, that sometimes the most sophisticated response is surrender to forces larger than yourself.

We had built our first line of defense not through medical intervention, but through the courage to trust. Whether that trust was placed in God, in nature, in our son's inherent resilience, or some combination of all three—we wouldn't know until he was born.

For now, all we could do was wait. And in that waiting, perhaps, we were learning something about protection that no amount of planning could have taught us.

What does it mean to protect those we love? Is it always about doing more, intervening harder, building stronger defenses? Or is there a kind of protection that comes from knowing when to let go—when to trust that the natural systems designed for resilience might work better without our interference?

These weren't rhetorical questions. They were the questions we would live with for the next several weeks, waiting for our son to be born, wondering if we'd chosen wisely or if we'd regret our surrender for the rest of our lives.

The first line of defense, we were discovering, isn't always about building barriers. Sometimes it's about having the wisdom to know when the strongest position is the one that looks like letting go.

### Protective mechanisms in crisis systems

Our experience with the Dutch healthcare system revealed both the strengths and limitations of formal protective mechanisms. In the Dutch Caribbean context, this mirrors how island economies structure their defenses against various threats.

The Kingdom Charter specifies that the Netherlands has a responsibility to respond in times of crisis for the Dutch Caribbean islands—almost like having a contingent line of credit with the Dutch government. However, this protection mechanism creates potential moral hazard. If islands can always rely on the Netherlands anyway, what incentive is there to invest in resilience during peaceful times?

The reality of this support proved complex after Hurricane Irma devastated Sint Maarten. The Netherlands, not trusting local capacity to effectively manage such a large reconstruction undertaking, entrusted the World Bank to manage the fund it capitalized. Years later, projects are still ongoing. It took several years before the fund was ready to disburse, and the World Bank's bureaucracy proved less nimble than hoped. When questioned about deElenas, the Netherlands pointed to the World Bank for execution issues, effectively washing their hands clean despite providing the money.

Similar patterns appear in other protective mechanisms. The Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) has proven effective over its ten-plus years of existence, with numerous disbursements following trigger events. However, the products remain too narrowly focused on natural events—hurricanes, excess rainfall, coastal protection for fisherfolk—doing little to protect against black swan events like pandemics. The COVID-19 crisis revealed that financial resilience products weren't designed for such unprecedented economic shocks.

This pattern of protective measures creating new vulnerabilities became viscerally clear when doctors explained that Neo needed to be placed on ECMO—extracorporeal membrane oxygenation—to survive. "If we don't move him to ECMO, he will not be able to make it on his own," they told us. The intervention was necessary for survival, but it came with permanent costs: sacrificing one of the main arteries to his head, increased bleeding risks due to blood thinners, and weeks of additional complications.

The ECMO decision perfectly illustrated the protection paradox. The intervention that saved Neo's life also permanently altered his anatomy and created new vulnerabilities. One of his primary blood vessels would never function again, though doctors assured us this wouldn't affect his quality of life. Like islands that accept external assistance during crisis, we had to weigh immediate survival against long-term constraints.

This specialized protection paradox also became evident when comparing different crisis responses. In Sint Maarten after Hurricane Irma, the lack of formal communication structure led to coordination failures. The Dutch army took responsibility for airport operations but created bottlenecks clearing cargo, leading to food for both humans and animals stuck at the airport while communities faced shortages. Formal protocols prioritized human food, but this rigid approach failed to account for the interconnected nature of the crisis.

By contrast, Aruba's COVID-19 response benefited from clear leadership and well-defined responsibilities. Hospital capacity management, vaccine distribution, health app implementation, and lockdown enforcement proceeded relatively smoothly because coordination systems were well-established.

### Decision frameworks under uncertainty

The doctor's words—"Sometimes doing nothing is everything that you can do"—revealed something profound about decision-making under extreme uncertainty. This wasn't about analytical frameworks or cost-benefit analysis. This was about recognizing the limits of human control and the wisdom of restraint when action might cause more harm than inaction.

As an economist, I typically rely on quantifying probabilities and analyzing data to reach rational conclusions. But in that hospital room, I found myself in territory where pure rationality reached its limits. "It's too complex, and I don't have the data I need," I told Elena Hing. This recognition—that some decisions cannot wait for perfect information and cannot be solved through analysis alone—proved fundamental to crisis management.

This philosophy connects to economic decision-making in uncertain times through the principle of focusing on what you can influence while recognizing that you cannot have anticipatory action covering all risks. Since complete risk mitigation would be neither efficient nor possible, you need to find peace with this uncertainty.

The COVID-19 lockdown decisions across Caribbean islands exemplified this principle. Each island had to decide whether to shut down tourism—their economic engine—without knowing how the economy would be maintained, how it would be financed, or what the long-term consequences for public finances would be. They saw debt-to-GDP ratios balloon as they accepted significant loans from the Netherlands to finance social protection and maintain government liquidity.

But they kept their priorities straight: immediate health concerns took precedence over future economic worries. As the biblical verse reminds us: "Do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Today's problems are sufficient for now." Given the choice between saving lives and protecting economic indicators, it was still a no-brainer to tackle the pandemic head-on, even without knowing how they would restore healthy public finances later.

### When protection requires surrender

The afternoon before Neo's major corrective surgery, we faced what would become the most transformative conversation of our entire medical journey. After a rushed morning trying to coordinate Sophie's school pickup with our appointment schedule, we arrived ten minutes late to meet with Dr. Wijsman, the surgeon who would operate the following day.

Dutch punctuality is no joke, and Dr. Wijsman's visible annoyance made clear that our tardiness was not appreciated. "OK, follow me," he said with an irritated expression that immediately filled me with dread. _This is the man who's going to operate on my son tomorrow,_ I thought, _and he seems to be in a terrible mood._

What followed was one of the most clinically detached medical consultations I had ever experienced. Dr. Wijsman drew the baby's thorax area with the mechanical precision of someone explaining a routine procedure. "When I operate tomorrow, I'm going to make a cut like this," he said, sketching a horizontal line, "or like this," adding a vertical option. "I'm not sure yet. Mostly the field seems to have a preference for this one, but I don't know. I kind of like the other one too. So we'll see. I haven't decided yet which it's going to be."

_Oh my God,_ I thought, _this guy is going to be butchering my son like he's a piece of meat. He has no empathy whatsoever._

The consultation grew worse. "And if the spleen starts to bleed, I will remove it," he announced matter-of-factly. "It's better to remove it, otherwise the risks of internal bleeding are just too large to risk the baby not surviving."

I must have turned pale. "But the spleen... it has a function, right? I mean, it's not there for nothing. You just remove it?"

"Well, it helps with your immune system and so on. But the point is, if it bleeds, my objective is to save your son. I can't run that risk of bleeding. So better to remove it to be safe."

Desperate for some reassurance, I asked, "So doctor, you have a lot of experience in this type of surgery, right?"

Still looking annoyed, he replied, "Yeah, I have been doing this my whole career. I have done it for many years in Nijmegen and many years here in Rotterdam. I'm probably the most experienced guy around."

Somehow, this didn't make me feel better. He concluded by emphasizing the gravity of our situation: "Your son is very, very sick. There is a real chance he will not survive. You have to be prepared that it's a real probability."

As the meeting wrapped up, Dr. Wijsman asked, "Is there anything else?"

That's when something extraordinary happened. Elena, normally quiet and reserved, said, "Actually doctor, I have an unusual question to ask you, if I may?"

I was shocked. _What is she going to say to this grumpy, annoyed doctor?_

"Yes, please go ahead," he replied, clearly curious.

"Is it OK if we pray with you?"

The audacity took my breath away. Here was my wife asking this visibly irritated, likely non-believing doctor to join us in prayer. _The balls on Elena,_ I thought, simultaneously impressed and terrified.

"Uh... yeah... sure... OK... if you would like, please do go ahead," he said, clearly as surprised as I was.

But then Elena turned to me: "OK Rendell, you lead us in prayer."

I must have turned pale again. I don't usually pray with other people—I do it alone because I feel self-conscious about my faith. Elena knew this about me! But with both her and the doctor looking at me expectantly, I felt completely cornered.

I closed my eyes and the words came. I asked God to work through this doctor, to guide his hands and give him the strength he needed to get the job done. I don't remember the exact words, but when I opened my eyes, it was as if Dr. Wijsman had been transformed into a completely different person.

"Thank you for that," he said immediately. "You know, I'm not a Christian. But I do believe in the power of the universe. So what I like to do, which I will do tomorrow, is before the operation put my hands on the baby and try to absorb energy to perform this operation. And you know, I can tell you one thing: I'm going to do my utmost best tomorrow. I'm going to give it everything to make this happen for your baby. And as soon as I'm out of the operation, I will come to you in the waiting room to let you know how it went."

Walking back to the apartment, Elena wanted to talk about what had just happened—the transformation in Dr. Wijsman, the feeling of divine presence. "Did you see how his whole face changed?" she kept saying. I was already analyzing it, filing it as data: intervention successful, surgeon now emotionally invested, probable improved surgical outcomes. She needed to feel the miracle; I needed to understand the mechanism. We were holding the same moment in completely different ways.

"You always do that," she said quietly. "Turn everything into analysis."

"And you always want everything to be about feelings," I replied, not unkindly, just stating fact. We'd had this conversation before. It usually ended with both of us retreating—her to her emotions, me to my spreadsheets. Tonight was no different.

### The paradox revealed

As we walked back to our apartment that evening, Elena and I were both quiet, processing what had just happened. The transformation in Dr. Wijsman's demeanor felt almost miraculous—from irritated professional going through motions to someone personally invested in our son's survival.

"I can't believe you asked him to pray," I finally said. "That took incredible courage."

Elena was thoughtful. "I felt like God was telling me this was our only chance. That surgeon was going to operate on our baby tomorrow, but he was disconnected, almost cold. How could we trust our son's life to someone who seemed so detached?"

What struck me most was the counterintuitive nature of what had just occurred. Every instinct screamed that we needed the most technically competent surgeon possible—credentials, experience, specialized knowledge. Yet what transformed our situation wasn't demanding better technical qualifications or insisting on additional safeguards. It was Elena's willingness to be completely vulnerable with someone who held our son's life in his hands.

"Sometimes the strongest protection comes from admitting how powerless you are," Elena reflected. "When I asked to pray, I wasn't trying to control anything. I was surrendering control."

This insight would prove central to everything that followed in our medical journey, though I didn't fully grasp it yet. **The principle was becoming clear: protection sometimes requires surrender.** The prayer hadn't changed Dr. Wijsman's surgical skills, but it had transformed the relationship through which those skills would be applied. By surrendering our need to manage and control, we had actually created better conditions for protection.

The same principle, I would later realize, applied to our decision about the FETO procedure. Choosing not to pursue the experimental intervention wasn't giving up on protecting our son—it was recognizing that sometimes the most protective choice feels like surrender. Rather than doing everything possible, we had chosen to trust in our baby's inherent resilience, accepting that we couldn't control the outcome regardless of our intervention choices.

We left the office in stunned silence earlier that day, but as we processed what had happened, I turned to Elena: "What was that? Why did you push me to pray?"

"As we were concluding the meeting, I heard God speak to me and say: 'Ask him to pray,'" she explained. "I didn't dare do so because he didn't seem receptive. But God said to me: 'You do it now, or never. Now is your only chance.' So I did. But once I asked the question, I felt I had complied with what God had asked me to do. The praying part—I didn't have courage for that, so I thought, well, I did enough, now you take care of that."

**This moment crystallized the principle that would guide us through everything that followed: protection sometimes requires surrender.** The most sophisticated medical intervention in the world requires more than technical expertise—it requires human connection, trust, and sometimes the courage to be vulnerable with the people on whom your life depends. True protection often emerges not from building stronger defenses or demanding more control, but from the wisdom to know when surrender creates better conditions for safety than resistance.

Elena's vulnerability had accomplished what no amount of advocacy or technical questioning could have achieved—it had transformed a detached professional interaction into a personal commitment. This wasn't just about interpersonal dynamics; it was about recognizing a fundamental truth about how protection actually works in crisis situations.

The surgery was successful, and afterward, we maintained a warm relationship with Dr. Wijsman. Even running into him months later, he would be genuinely happy to see how Neo had progressed. That conversation taught us that sometimes seeking protection requires surrendering control, that the most effective defenses emerge from authentic human connection rather than merely technical competence.

It was a lesson I wished we could apply as easily to our marriage as we had to our medical crisis. With Dr. Wijsman, vulnerability had created connection. In our relationship, the same vulnerability often felt like exposure of incompatibilities we weren't sure how to address. Crisis had given us a shared enemy to unite against, but it hadn't taught us how to navigate the subtler work of partnership when the external threat was gone.

### The protection paradox

The principle Elena had discovered—that protection sometimes requires surrender—proved more complex than we initially realized. As our medical journey continued, I began to see how our family's traditional protective strategies were themselves creating new vulnerabilities.

Before Kayden's crisis, we had built what felt like a robust life: career success, financial stability, strong professional networks, predictable routines. These protective measures had served us well through many smaller challenges—economic downturns in Aruba, professional setbacks, even relationship tensions. Our specialized adaptations to island life seemed to provide security.

But faced with a medical emergency requiring indefinite relocation, some of these very strengths became complications. The professional obligations that had provided financial security now created stress about extended absence from clients. The financial planning that assumed predictable expenses suddenly faced open-ended medical costs in a foreign country. The local networks that had always supported us couldn't help with Dutch bureaucracy or Rotterdam hospital systems.

Most tellingly, my analytical approach to problem-solving—which had made me effective as an economist and consultant—kept hitting walls in medical situations that required patience with uncertainty rather than immediate solutions. Elena's instinct for surrender had accessed something my protective strategies couldn't reach.

This personal revelation connected to a broader pattern I was observing in my research. Caribbean tourism economies provided a perfect parallel. Over decades, tourism had proven quite resilient to various shocks—the Natalee Holloway case didn't impact Aruba significantly, financial crises had limited effects. This track record made tourism specialization seem like a robust protective strategy, just as our professional focus had seemed to provide security.

But then came COVID-19, which created a completely novel threat: the total shutdown of global travel. The tourism "shell" that had protected island economies for decades offered no defense against this unprecedented challenge. The very specialization that had provided stability and growth became the source of acute vulnerability.

The pattern was becoming clear to me: the most effective defenses against known threats often leave systems exposed to novel challenges they never evolved to handle. Perfect adaptation to current conditions can create brittleness when tomorrow's challenges emerge. Elena's willingness to surrender control had created better protection than all my careful planning and analysis.

The protection paradox reminded us that true resilience requires more than building stronger defenses—it requires the wisdom to know when surrender creates better conditions for safety than resistance. Sometimes the shell itself becomes the constraint.

### First responders: Formal and informal

The formal medical system had clear, narrow definitions of our crisis. Elena was the patient, bringing one "begeleider" (myself) covered by insurance. When Neo was born, he would become the patient, Elena would become the begeleider, and I would cease to have formal support. The system viewed this as a medical crisis, not a family crisis.

This bureaucratic logic created immediate gaps that informal networks rushed to fill. Suyin's presence during our FETO decision became crucial—by watching Sophie, she allowed us to focus entirely on the life-changing choice we faced without the additional stress of managing a seven-year-old's questions during our most critical hour. This simple act of friendship enabled the decision-making process to proceed with the clarity it required.

Throughout our stay, these informal networks provided what formal systems couldn't account for. Two aunties and a distant aunt took care of Sophie during planned medical events when we had zero time for her. They ensured her life continued—taking her to school, shopping, fun activities—keeping her mind off the stress of her parents' unavailability and our family's overwhelming anxiety.

Friends who had been distant acquaintances became close supporters. The night we arrived in Holland, despite our exhaustion, they picked us up from the hotel and took us to an activity center where children could play. Their daughter became a good friend to Sophie throughout our stay, providing the social connection she desperately needed in an unfamiliar environment.

When Neo was born, these same friends brought chicken wings to our little hospital room, where Elena was still recovering from childbirth. We were so grateful for this thoughtful gesture because we had very little attention for basic needs like food, yet the simple act of sharing a meal together felt like normalcy amid chaos.

Even before we left Aruba, informal networks had proven essential. A friend who had experienced a similar medical journey with their infant daughter at Sophia Kinderziekenhuis provided invaluable advice. Various family members and acquaintances contributed pieces of information that helped me develop a strategy to convince our health insurance to send us to the Netherlands.

The digital informal networks proved equally vital. Facebook groups dedicated to CHD provided both sobering reality and hope. Reading about children who died was painful, but seeing pictures of children who grew up well offered encouragement. Platform CHD of the Netherlands was particularly helpful, with their wealth of information about what to expect in the Dutch medical system. The chairperson, Frank, jumped on a video call to answer questions as I prepared to write to our health insurer.

What struck me about all these informal responses was their speed and intuitive accuracy. People understood immediately where help was needed and took action without being asked, without formal protocols, without bureaucratic approval. While Erasmus MC provided excellent broader support—including the Ronald McDonald House, psychological support, social workers, and activities for siblings—the informal networks filled gaps the formal system couldn't even recognize existed.

This pattern of organic community response reminded me of what I'd observed in my research across Caribbean islands. Following Hurricane Irma, great solidarity emerged in Sint Maarten, with individuals and the private sector stepping in to assist with livelihood protection, supplementing what NGOs and the government were doing. During COVID-19, similar patterns appeared across the region—people identifying needs and responding before official systems could mobilize.

My research on the comcomber chikito had revealed how this informal resilience operates at the household level. Food producers operating on non-commercial terms were much more inclined to donate produce to food banks and provide mutual aid during crises, compared to commercial producers who had formal financial obligations to investors. Similarly, informal micro-activities like keeping backyard chickens for fresh eggs proved more resilient to supply chain disruptions than commercial operations dependent on imported feed.

Living through our own crisis taught me that the informal economy's greatest value lies in its capacity for solidarity and sharing—protective mechanisms that formal systems struggle to replicate or account for in their protocols. The speed, flexibility, and human understanding that characterize informal networks often make them the true first responders in any crisis.

### Waiting and preparing

After making the FETO decision, we faced a long waiting period until the baby would be induced at week 38. Between then and the decision, there would be some check-ups to monitor progress, but the primary assignment was for Elena Hing to take it easy and wait for the birth date to be set.

This waiting period proved valuable in unexpected ways. We went home and tried to prepare as much as possible—both practically and mentally. Elena Hing got some time to quickly complete work projects, anticipating that she would not be able to work for a long time once the baby was born. We focused on Sophie, working to get her enrolled in school, which proved more challenging than I had anticipated.

Other logistical planning included figuring out where to stay—could we remain at the Ronald McDonald House? Who would look after Sophie during critical medical periods? These practical concerns required attention while we waited.

The waiting also provided precious time for the three of us to spend together. We got to know Rotterdam a bit by walking around—the doctor had recommended that Elena walk regularly. Most importantly, we had time to prepare mentally for what was to come, with many unanswered questions and anticipation, but also finding comfort in placing our burden on God.

This experience changed my perspective on protective versus adaptive strategies. I realized that protective strategies are often undervalued. In crisis situations, there's a strong inclination to act—to do something. But action doesn't necessarily mean making the right choices that actually help. In such cases, it's better to keep cool, because protective choices can be more intentional and ultimately more effective.

For example, with Aruba facing potential trade shocks from Trump tariffs while COVID-19 is still in recent memory, it might be easier to give in and have the government intervene in anticipation. But it's unclear if that would be an effective strategy or even if it will be needed at all. Better to keep our heads cool and start planning for things we can control—preparing policy actions without implementing them until it's really necessary according to predetermined scenarios and triggers, then acting decisively when those points are reached.

During our waiting period, we had each other, and most importantly, we had God. In my personal case, this experience really cemented my faith. It is in moments when you feel you have no control over the future that the only thing you can do is surrender to God—not just in thoughts, like a rational decision, but complete surrender. Once you do that, you move from the stage of knowing about God to really knowing Him, having a relationship where you feel secure that He has your back. That's real faith.

The first line of defense, we learned, isn't always about building stronger barriers or taking immediate action. Sometimes it's about having the wisdom to wait, the strength to surrender control, and the faith to trust in something greater than our own protective measures. True resilience emerges from this balance between appropriate action and appropriate restraint, between building defenses and maintaining the flexibility to adapt when those defenses prove insufficient. But making the right decision was only the beginning. The real price of protection—financial, emotional, physical—would reveal itself in ways we never anticipated as we settled into our new reality in Rotterdam.  

The FETO decision taught us that choosing the right protective strategy was only the beginning of our journey. What we couldn't anticipate was how seeking protection would extract a price that extended far beyond medical bills or travel costs—demanding payment in ways that would reshape our bodies, our relationships, and our understanding of what it truly means to be safe in an uncertain world.
