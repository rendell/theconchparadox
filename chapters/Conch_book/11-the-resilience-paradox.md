## The question beneath the question

Sitting in that office—surrounded by conch paintings, economics books, the accumulated artifacts of my professional identity—I found myself remembering my supervisor's words from that video call years earlier.

_"If you're looking for a resilient creature, shouldn't we be looking at a cockroach instead?"_

At the time, it had felt like a punch to the gut. My beautiful metaphor, dismissed with Dutch directness. I'd retreated, agreed to mention the conch only briefly, let the idea hibernate until I could defend it properly.

But now, staring at the painting of the shell I'd been unconsciously replicating in my own life, I realized he'd asked exactly the right question—just not in the way either of us understood then.

The cockroach _is_ more resilient than the conch, by any conventional measure. It survives arctic cold and tropical heat. It outlasts pesticides and radiation. It will be here long after the queen conch has vanished from Caribbean waters, long after we have solved or succumbed to the challenges we currently face.

The cockroach achieves this invulnerability through a simple strategy: specialize in nothing. Develop no distinctive capability worth protecting. Be adequate everywhere, optimal nowhere. No magnificent shell, no specialized feeding apparatus, no unique role in the ecosystem.

It simply persists.

Must we become like the roach to survive? Is that the escape from the paradox I'd been documenting in my research and living in my marriage?

The question haunted me because it exposed something the resilience discourse almost never examines. When policymakers talk about building resilient economies, when consultants sell resilience frameworks, when I advise the World Bank on disaster risk financing—no one pauses to ask the prior question: _Resilient for what purpose? Survival of what, exactly?_

The cockroach answers this question by refusing to ask it. Persistence is the goal. Continuation is the point. Nothing else matters.

But when I think about Small Island Developing States—about their distinctive cultures, their unique ecological relationships, their hard-won governance innovations—I don't see communities aspiring to cockroach resilience. The fisherman in Bonaire doesn't want his grandchildren to merely persist; he wants them to know the reef, to read the currents, to carry forward a relationship with the sea that took generations to develop. That knowledge, that connection, that specialized way of being—it's what makes survival meaningful.

The conch plays a keystone role in Caribbean marine ecosystems. Its grazing maintains seagrass beds. Its shells provide habitat for smaller creatures. When the conch disappears from a reef system, the effects cascade through the entire community. The conch _matters_ in ways the cockroach never will.

The conch's vulnerability is the price of its significance.

And there it was—the question hiding beneath all our resilience talk, beneath my research, beneath the mediation paperwork sitting on my desk: Are we trying to persist, or are we trying to preserve something worth persisting?

The answer changes everything.

If mere survival is the goal, then the cockroach strategy makes sense. Shed your distinctiveness. Abandon your specialized capabilities. Become infinitely flexible and perpetually mediocre. You will never go extinct.

But you will also never be magnificent.

If, however, the goal is to preserve something meaningful—a culture, a capability, a way of being in the world that cannot be easily replicated, a marriage that is more than two people cohabitating efficiently—then the paradox cannot be escaped. It can only be navigated.

The shell that makes you significant is the same shell that makes you vulnerable. The expertise that gives you value is the same expertise that creates blind spots. The relationship patterns that create intimacy are the same patterns that can calcify into constraint.

My supervisor had been right to challenge me. The conch _is_ endangered. The cockroach _would_ survive longer. But he'd asked the question as if survival were the only metric that mattered—and I'd been too defensive about my metaphor to recognize what his challenge actually revealed.

The conch paradox isn't a flaw in my argument. It's the entire point.

There is no escape from the paradox for those of us unwilling to become cockroaches. There is only the question of what we're trying to preserve, and whether we have the wisdom to know when our protective shells are serving that purpose and when they've begun to suffocate it.

## What transformation looks like

But if the paradox cannot be escaped—only navigated—what does successful navigation actually look like? Is transformation even possible once you've built your shell?

On Namibia's Skeleton Coast, where the Namib Desert meets the Atlantic, there is an answer of sorts. Lions once hunted seals on those beaches. Not metaphorically. Actual lions, walking the shoreline at night, stalking marine prey as waves crashed in the darkness. A terrestrial apex predator hunting creatures of the sea.

It sounds impossible until you learn the history.

For generations, this population had adapted to one of Earth's harshest environments by becoming something lions aren't supposed to be. They had learned to survive without regular water, to range across territories ten times larger than their savanna cousins, to hunt in ways their ancestors never imagined. Then conflict with farmers nearly wiped them out. The survivors retreated inland. By 1990, the beach lions were gone.

When lions finally returned to the coast in 2002, conservationists noticed something troubling: they stood at the edge of abundance—thousands of fur seals stretched along the shoreline—and didn't recognize it as food. The knowledge had died with the previous generation. What had been learned could be unlearned. What had been possible could become unimaginable.

Then came the drought.

Year after year, the desert's already scarce prey disappeared. The lions faced a choice that wasn't really a choice at all.

What happened next haunts me. Three orphaned lionesses—cubs who had lost their mother, who had no pride teaching them "this is how we survive"—began doing what their species hadn't done in decades. They walked to the ocean. They watched the seals. And slowly, through trial and error, they relearned what their ancestors had known.

Why orphans? Why not the established pride with their accumulated wisdom?

Perhaps there's something about being unburdened—about having no one to tell you what's possible and what isn't—that creates space for rediscovery. The orphans didn't know they were attempting the impossible. They only knew they were hungry, and there was food they couldn't yet reach.

One lioness was observed killing forty seals in a single night.

I think about this story when I consider the difference between the conch and creatures that can choose. The conch's shell is not a strategy but a structure—grown slowly over years, fused to its body, impossible to abandon. When conditions change, the conch has no choice but to carry its accumulated protection into a world where that protection has become weight.

But the lions could walk somewhere new. They could stand at the edge of an unfamiliar ocean and, eventually, recognize that what looked impossible might actually be survival.

Can we?

The honest answer is: sometimes. And perhaps that's the most important word in the entire question. Not _always_. Not _easily_. Not _without cost_. But sometimes, when the drought is severe enough, when the old prey has vanished entirely, when orphaned circumstances strip away the voice that says "this is how we've always done it"—sometimes transformation becomes possible.

The harder question is whether we must wait for the drought. Whether we can learn to see the seals while the oryx are still plentiful. Whether recognition can come before devastation forces it.

Sitting with these questions in my Savaneta office, I began to see how they applied not just to island economies but to the patterns emerging in my own household.

## Different kinds of resilience

The protective mechanisms that had made me effective during acute family crisis were becoming barriers to the kind of intimacy and partnership Lay required for long-term relationship health.

Crisis resilience and relationship resilience, I was learning, require fundamentally different capabilities. During Neo's medical emergency, my analytical approach served us brilliantly: identify the problem, research solutions, implement fixes, measure outcomes. The feedback loops were clear. The roles were defined. Success meant keeping our son alive.

But marriage required different capabilities entirely: staying present with uncomfortable emotions, tolerating uncertainty about outcomes, engaging repeatedly with the same underlying tensions without expecting definitive resolution. Lay needed me to understand her feelings, not solve her problems. She needed me to engage with the emotional content of our conflicts, not retreat to develop better systems for avoiding them.

Small Island Developing States face similar challenges distinguishing between crisis resilience and adaptive resilience. Islands that successfully weather hurricanes or economic shocks may still struggle with the slower, more complex work of structural transformation required for long-term sustainability. Crisis response mobilizes existing capabilities against clearly defined threats. Adaptive transformation requires fundamental reorganization of systems that may be functioning adequately under normal conditions but lack the flexibility to thrive amid ongoing change.

My marriage was struggling with precisely this transition—from crisis management to ongoing partnership development. We had proven our capacity to unite against external threats. But we lacked the frameworks for addressing internal tensions that didn't lend themselves to analytical solutions.

The conch paradox was revealing itself in my personal life with uncomfortable clarity. The same protective mechanisms—analytical distance, independent decision-making, retreat to controlled environments—that had served me well in certain contexts were now constraining my capacity for the emotional engagement that sustained partnership requires.

## The paradox emerges

By the time Lay suggested we might need professional help to address our relationship patterns, I had perfected my retreat mechanisms to the point where they felt automatic. Difficult conversations triggered immediate impulses to withdraw to my office, to process conflicts intellectually rather than emotionally, to seek solutions that would minimize future uncomfortable interactions.

My beautiful, comfortable office had become more than a workspace—it was a physical manifestation of my psychological pattern of seeking protection through isolation. Every day, I sat across from my conch painting, unconsciously living out the very patterns my research had identified as problematic, yet somehow missing the connection entirely.

The queen conch's magnificent shell, perfected over millions of years, now threatens its survival in rapidly changing ocean conditions. The specialized adaptation that ensured protection against familiar predators offers no defense against novel threats like warming waters and industrial fishing.

My own adaptive patterns were following a similar trajectory. The analytical capabilities and independence that had served me well professionally, and even during our family medical crisis, were becoming liabilities in the changed conditions of post-crisis marriage where Lay needed different kinds of engagement and support.

The resilience that had carried us through Rotterdam was revealing itself as insufficient for the ongoing work of building sustainable partnership. We would need to develop new capabilities, or risk discovering that surviving acute crisis together doesn't guarantee the ability to thrive during the quieter challenges that follow.

I was the conch. The office was my shell. And somewhere in the back of my mind, a question was beginning to form that I wasn't yet ready to answer:

What would it mean to walk to the ocean's edge—to stand before an unfamiliar challenge and recognize that what looked impossible might actually be survival?

What would it mean to become, in some necessary way, orphaned from my own expertise?

The conch painting watched from the wall, patient as it had always been, holding an answer I wasn't yet ready to see.
