## Chapter 5: Sensing Change

March 18th arrived with snow—the first we'd seen since arriving in Rotterdam. From our room high in the Erasmus Hospital complex, Lay and I watched the city transform under white. The Museum Boijmans dome wore a snow cap. The Erasmus Bridge stretched across the distance. After a false start the day before, today would be Neo's birthday.

By afternoon, Lay was in the delivery room, the induction process intensifying. Between contractions, I caught her on video with a large bag of Lay's potato chips, munching away with a guilty smile. "Give me a break," she laughed, "I'm hungry." We were grasping for normalcy in the surreal.

Then four people appeared, wheeling in equipment. "Don't mind us," they said, setting up the PINC unit beside the bed—an experimental system where the baby could be stabilized on a tray above the mother's belly without immediately cutting the umbilical cord. The idea was elegant: the longer the baby stayed connected to the mother's circulation, the better his chances of avoiding lung problems. We'd been selected for this trial, a 50-50 chance we'd gratefully received. Working with nature's design rather than against it.

As delivery approached, everything changed. "He's turned," the midwife said. The baby who had been perfectly positioned was now breech. What followed was the pattern I'd come to recognize: examine, leave to discuss, return with decisions we could only accept or reject.

The epidural came first—insurance against emergency C-section. I held Lay's hand, grateful to be facing her so I couldn't see the needle. Then came the manual turning, the medical team applying what seemed like enormous pressure to Lay's belly. They succeeded. Neo was in position.

That's when the room exploded.

The moment word spread that delivery was imminent, medical professionals poured in. We estimated forty people—PINC team, midwives, gynecologists, medical students, NICU team waiting in the hallway. The intimate space had become an amphitheater.

Our gynecologist walked in and boomed: "Everyone without a direct role—behind the observation window." Twenty people shuffled behind the glass partition. With seven words, he'd transformed chaos into controlled space.

One medical student proved cleverer than the rest. "I can take photos with your phone so you don't have to worry," she offered. I handed it over gratefully, only realizing later she'd found her excuse to stay inside the circle.

When Lay's waters broke, it was like a fountain—everywhere, far more than expected. "Common with CDH babies," someone murmured. "The body produces extra fluid."

Neo emerged fighting. He wasn't supposed to cry—his underdeveloped lungs shouldn't have allowed it—but his voice rang out before they could intubate him. On the PINC tray, forty hands moved in orchestration. Someone attempted intubation while Neo fought, his tiny arm pushing against the tube. Our gynecologist called out saturation levels in a loud, urgent voice, each number a verdict. The levels were concerning. Everyone moved with increased intensity.

"Let me try," another doctor offered. "No," she said firmly. "I've got this."

An eternity later, she succeeded. The numbers climbed. Through it all, Lay cried, rubbing Neo's feet. I cried. We'd forgotten the twenty people watching through glass.

Then, unexpectedly: "Would you like to hold him?"

It wasn't protocol. But someone understood that the human objective mattered too. Lay held our fragile son, tubes everywhere, for precious moments.

"We'll be taking him to NICU now. Father, you can follow."

I kissed Lay goodbye and ran to keep up with the NICU team rushing Neo through corridors, texting while running: "Baby born. Seems stable. Heading to NICU."

### Learning the language of crisis

What impacted me most at Neo's birth was the intensity of interventions the moment he emerged. From that first moment when the doctor called out his vital signs—saturation levels, heart rate, blood pressure—guiding the team's stabilization efforts, I became fixated on these numbers. Saturation became my primary window into my son's struggle for life.

Once Neo was transported to the NICU, I found myself staring at monitors displaying information I desperately needed to understand. I began asking nurses repeatedly to explain what they were looking at—saturation, heart function, respiratory support settings. The first day was a real struggle to get Neo stable. He was fighting hard, and the head doctor had explained they had a plan of progressively more aggressive measures: intubation, medication, stronger medications, and ultimately ECMO.

In practice, what we experienced were alarms constantly going off. Red lights beeping when his saturation dropped below acceptable thresholds. I found myself staring at the screen, trying to spot patterns while nurses rushed in to address each alarm. This was incredibly stressful. The screen kept flashing red, the alarm sounds never stopped. Lay later told me that even when sleeping, she could hear those sounds echoing in her head.

Unfortunately, Neo's worsening condition meant he had to be placed on ECMO—extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, essentially an artificial lung and heart outside his body that would do the work his organs couldn't manage. This life-saving intervention brought new complications and risks. Now he was at risk of internal bleeding because of the blood thinners necessary to prevent clots. They had to sacrifice one of his main arteries to his head for the connection—a permanent alteration that doctors assured us wouldn't affect his quality of life.

A new screen monitored his brain activity. They measured everything—urine output, stool weight, brain activity, drainage from various tubes. I found myself studying each measurement, asking about every reading.

I quickly evolved from being a very involved parent asking good questions to becoming the annoying parent with a million questions. I could see it in their reactions as soon as I walked in—you could almost hear them thinking, "Oh God, here he comes again." They would try to shut me down with short, unfriendly answers before I even fully articulated my concerns.

### When parents know best

One morning, Lay and I noticed that Neo's belly looked a bit swollen. We mentioned it to the nurse, who said it was probably residual blood that would clear up. But it kept getting worse. Every time we noted it to the nursing staff, we received the same dismissive response.

Then one morning, a nurse asked us directly: "What do you see?" We confirmed that it was definitely looking worse. She replied: "I've already reported it to the medical staff, but I'll make a note that the parents said that's what they see, because that adds to the sense of urgency."

Here I was pleased that they valued our perspective. As the doctor had mentioned during our pre-birth NICU tour, parents spend every day with the baby and know them best.

The doctors eventually decided to operate, and the timing was critical. The belly was turning blue, and there was significant pressure on the intestines, which were already turning gray when the operation happened. They discovered bleeding from a central line that they thought they had fixed, but the bleeding had continued internally.

This reinforced something important: parents keeping close watch often notice things medical staff might miss or deprioritize.

### The trust negotiation

There was one incident that crystallized the communication challenges we faced. Neo's saturation level dropped very low, and the nurse attending to him seemed slow in responding effectively and looked nervous doing so. While Lay was sitting next to his bed, she felt helpless watching what appeared to be ineffective care. She began crying, seeing what was happening.

The next day, the same nurse approached Lay directly: "Tell me, do you think I was doing a bad job?" This made Lay cry again because she didn't want confrontation. She's very indirect and felt extremely uncomfortable with this Dutch directness.

This episode prompted me to request a meeting with the head doctor. I addressed the incident, explaining that while we did think the nurse wasn't being effective, it wasn't appropriate for her to confront my wife directly. I also pointed out that culturally we might be less direct than the Dutch.

I also used the opportunity to discuss my constant questioning. I explained that feeling so helpless, I needed to understand what was happening by asking as many questions as possible. I had come to realize the nurses were experiencing this as a nuisance.

The head doctor's response was brilliant. She said she would talk to the nurses about this and asked which nurses would like to volunteer to work with Neo, understanding this would require a friendly approach. This created a sudden change—we got new, friendly nurses, and the dynamic improved dramatically.

But she did something even more innovative. Recognizing my need for information and control, she said: "I see you're really interested in keeping a close eye on the indicators. As it happens, there's a student working on a dashboard that we hope will provide information to caregivers in the future. It's in an early beta phase, but if you'd like, I could check if it's an option for you to test it out."

I immediately signed up. This was apparently the first time the system was tested with parents. All the important data was there—vitals, weight, medications. For the first few days, nurses frequently asked questions and needed reassurance that this test was allowed. I thought it was a brilliant tool because it gave me a sense of control over information without having to constantly bother nurses with questions.

### The paranoia problem

Constant monitoring can become pathological. I found myself wanting to see Neo's monitors throughout the night, even when staying at the Ronald McDonald House. While he was under constant professional supervision, I couldn't relax without visual confirmation of his status.

The transition unit created its own psychological pressures. Unlike intensive care where professional staff maintained constant vigilance, this space was designed to gradually shift responsibility to parents. The nursing staff was intentionally limited—the whole point was for families to become comfortable taking over their child's care before going home. But we expected immediate response when we pressed the call button.

Our fear was specific and consuming: what if Neo spent precious energy crying while no one bothered to check? Energy he needed for weight gain and growth. After several exchanges with nurses about nighttime protocols, I reached a breaking point. I was certain they weren't being attentive enough, and I decided to prove it.

One evening, I went through the usual bedtime routine with the nurse—feeding, bathing, pajamas, tucking Neo in. When he was sleeping peacefully, I said my usual goodbyes and returned to the Ronald McDonald House. But talking to Lay, I voiced my suspicion: "I'm sure if he's crying, they won't look after him properly. I want to know for sure."

So I returned later that night, determined to conduct my own surveillance operation.

The whole unit was dark after bedtime, and when I opened the door, there were no nurses at the central desk. I carefully made my way to Neo's room and confirmed he was sleeping peacefully.

Then I did something that still makes me cringe: I positioned a chair in the darkest corner by the window, away from the medical equipment lights but with clear sight lines to both Neo and the hallway. And I sat there for hours, like some kind of intensive care detective.

Around 10 PM, I watched a nurse walk by and peek briefly through the window to confirm Neo was sleeping peacefully before moving on. "Ha!" I thought to myself. "Look—she's not even taking the time to come inside the room." This wasn't entirely fair, since Neo was connected to monitors they could observe from their desk.

I remained in my dark corner until around midnight, when a nurse finally entered the room. She didn't turn on the lights—properly avoiding waking the baby—but used a small flashlight to check the equipment and observe Neo. I sat completely still, hands folded as if in prayer, invisible in the darkness.

After she finished her checks, I decided to reveal my presence. "Uh-hum," I said softly.

She nearly jumped out of her skin. "Oh my God, I didn't know there was someone in here!"

"Yeah," I replied with studied casualness. "Just wanted to spend time with Neo, see how he spends his nights."

She quickly left the room, clearly shaken.

In hindsight, this was a cruel thing to do. My motives were entirely vindictive: to make a statement that I was watching their actions. It was the behavior of a desperate parent who had lost all sense of appropriate boundaries.

Lay was mortified when she heard about my midnight surveillance. "You scared that poor nurse! What were you thinking?"

"I was thinking they weren't monitoring him properly—"

"I know they weren't!" she interrupted. "I've been worried about the same thing. But hiding in the dark? Jumping out at her?" She shook her head. "There are ways to handle concerns, Rendell. We could have talked to the head doctor together, requested a meeting..."

"I tried talking. They weren't listening."

"So you decided to become some kind of spy?" She sat down heavily. "I'm worried about Neo too. Every second. But this... this isn't how we solve things."

"We're supposed to be a team," she said quietly.

We were a team—in crisis management, in logistics, in keeping Neo alive. But somewhere between the medical decisions and the daily survival, we'd stopped being partners in the way that mattered.

### Learning to read the signals

Not long after my surveillance stunt, another nurse approached me with genuine concern. I must have looked terrible—hair a mess, eyes showing exhaustion I refused to acknowledge.

"Are you okay?" she asked.

"Yeah, I'm fine," I replied automatically. "Just want to check up on Neo."

She wasn't having any of it. "I really want you to take a night off and go rest. You need to sleep in your own bed rather than constantly hovering over Neo. I will personally take care of Neo tonight so you don't have to worry."

Her insistence felt both caring and firm—a nurse who understood that she was treating the whole family, not just the patient. In hindsight, I suspect this intervention was connected to my earlier surveillance incident. The nursing staff was pushing back against behavior they recognized as unhealthy.

Months later, around discharge time, the head doctor confirmed my suspicions. She mentioned that she had received considerable feedback from the nursing staff about us as parents. "I told them they needed to be more understanding," she explained. "You went through a lot, and you're not even in your home country. They needed to understand where some of that behavior was coming from."

Learning to trust the professional monitoring systems while maintaining appropriate parental vigilance became one of the most difficult aspects of our entire experience. But it also revealed something important: even when we were at our most difficult, the medical team understood that caring for critically ill children means caring for their families too, including protecting parents from their own destructive impulses born of love and fear.
