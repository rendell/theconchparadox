## Chapter 6: The Adaptation Dilemma

A week after Neo was born and placed in the NICU, we faced what would become the most transformative conversation of our entire medical journey. After a rushed morning trying to coordinate Amelie's school pickup with our appointment schedule, we arrived ten minutes late to meet with Dr. Wijsman, the surgeon who would perform Neo's major corrective surgery the following day.

Dutch punctuality is no joke, and Dr. Wijsman's visible annoyance made clear that our tardiness was not appreciated. "OK, follow me," he said with an irritated expression that immediately filled me with dread. _This is the man who's going to operate on my son tomorrow,_ I thought, _and he seems to be in a terrible mood._

What followed was one of the most clinically detached medical consultations I had ever experienced. Dr. Wijsman drew the baby's thorax area with mechanical precision. "When I operate tomorrow, I'm going to make a cut like this," he said, sketching a horizontal line, "or like this," adding a vertical option. "I'm not sure yet. Mostly the field seems to have a preference for this one, but I don't know. I kind of like the other one too. So we'll see. I haven't decided yet which it's going to be."

_Oh my God,_ I thought, _this guy is going to be butchering my son like he's a piece of meat._

The consultation grew worse. "And if the spleen starts to bleed, I will remove it," he announced matter-of-factly. "It's better to remove it, otherwise the risks of internal bleeding are just too large to risk the baby not surviving."

I must have turned pale. "But the spleen... it has a function, right? I mean, it's not there for nothing. You just remove it?"

"Well, it helps with your immune system and so on. But the point is, if it bleeds, my objective is to save your son. I can't run that risk of bleeding. So better to remove it to be safe."

Desperate for some reassurance, I asked, "So doctor, you have a lot of experience in this type of surgery, right?"

Still looking annoyed, he replied, "Yeah, I have been doing this my whole career. I have done it for many years in Nijmegen and many years here in Rotterdam. I'm probably the most experienced guy around."

Somehow, this didn't make me feel better. He concluded by emphasizing the gravity of our situation: "Your son is very, very sick. There is a real chance he will not survive. You have to be prepared that it's a real probability."

As the meeting wrapped up, Dr. Wijsman asked, "Is there anything else?"

That's when something extraordinary happened. Lay, normally quiet and reserved, said, "Actually doctor, I have an unusual question to ask you, if I may?"

I was shocked. _What is she going to say to this grumpy, annoyed doctor?_

"Yes, please go ahead," he replied, clearly curious.

"Is it OK if we pray with you?"

The audacity took my breath away. Here was my wife asking this visibly irritated, likely non-believing doctor to join us in prayer. _The balls on Lay,_ I thought, simultaneously impressed and terrified.

"Uh... yeah... sure... OK... if you would like, please do go ahead," he said, clearly as surprised as I was.

But then Lay turned to me: "OK Rendell, you lead us in prayer."

I must have turned pale again. I tried to gracefully deflect: "Oh no, you go ahead, Lay. You're the one who asked."

Dr. Wijsman looked at us both, clearly waiting. The silence stretched uncomfortably. He seemed to be thinking: _OK, are you guys doing this or what?_

"No," Lay said firmly. "YOU pray, Rendell."

I felt completely trapped. I don't usually pray with other people—I do it alone because I feel self-conscious about my faith. Lay knew this about me! But with both her and the doctor looking at me expectantly, I had no choice.

I closed my eyes and the words came. I asked God to work through this doctor, to guide his hands and give him the strength he needed to get the job done. When I opened my eyes, it was as if Dr. Wijsman had been transformed into a completely different person.

"Thank you for that," he said immediately. "You know, I'm not a Christian. But I do believe in the power of the universe. So what I like to do, which I will do tomorrow, is before the operation put my hands on the baby and try to absorb energy to perform this operation. And you know, I can tell you one thing: I'm going to do my utmost best tomorrow. I'm going to give it everything to make this happen for your baby. And as soon as I'm out of the operation, I will come to you in the waiting room to let you know how it went."

Walking back through the hospital corridors, we were both quiet at first, processing what had just happened. But as soon as we were out of earshot of Dr. Wijsman's office, I turned to Lay.

"I can't believe you put me in that position," I said, my voice still shaky from the encounter.

She stopped walking and looked at me directly. "As we were concluding the meeting, I heard God speak to me and say: 'Ask him to pray,'" she explained. "I didn't dare do it at first because he didn't seem receptive at all. But God said to me: 'You do it now, or never. Now is your only chance.'"

I stared at her. "So you just... decided to ask?"

"I felt like I had complied with what God had asked me to do once I asked the question," she continued. "The praying part—I didn't have courage for that, so I thought, well, I did enough. I did what was asked of me. Now the rest is up to you."

The relief in her voice was evident. She'd felt the divine pressure to act, had summoned the courage to make the impossible request, and then—mission accomplished—had passed the terrifying execution to me.

"You knew I hate praying in front of people," I said.

"I know," she said, starting to walk again. "But you were the only one who could do it. Not me, not right then. It had to be you."

I was already analyzing it, filing it as data: intervention successful, surgeon now emotionally invested, probable improved surgical outcomes. She needed to feel the miracle; I needed to understand the mechanism. We were holding the same moment in completely different ways.

"You always do that," she said quietly. "Turn everything into analysis."

"And you always want everything to be about feelings," I replied, not unkindly, just stating fact. We'd had this conversation before. It usually ended with both of us retreating—her to her emotions, me to my spreadsheets. Tonight was no different.

But something had shifted in that medical office that would prove more significant than either of us realized. Sometimes the most powerful adaptation requires becoming vulnerable in ways that terrify you. The prayer hadn't changed Dr. Wijsman's surgical skills, but it had transformed the relationship through which those skills would be applied.

This was adaptation at its most challenging: to save our son, we had to become people we'd never been before.

### Finding community in displacement

While I was learning to pray with strangers, Amelie was discovering her own forms of adaptation in the international classroom of her Rotterdam school. She told me about two Ukrainian girls in her class—Oksana, who had been there when Amelie started, and Katya, who arrived after summer break when Amelie was beginning her second school year.

When I met Oksana's mother at school, I discovered they weren't typical refugees. This was a professional family, high-skilled migrants who had moved because of the war but were considered expats rather than asylum seekers. Still, the children shared something profound with Amelie: the sudden experience of being in a strange country, having to start a new life overnight.

What touched me most was watching Amelie help Katya when she arrived. After months of being the new girl herself, Amelie finally got to experience helping someone else feel comfortable. "You're Ukrainian too?" she said, introducing Katya to Oksana. "Come meet my friend."

The cultural mixing was perhaps most evident at Amelie's birthday party. Lay organized it at a party venue, which proved challenging with transportation, especially on a night when it was raining hard. The Aruban children from our friends' families—six kids in total from three different families—mixed easily with the Ukrainian girls. For Katya's mother, everything about Aruba was completely unknown, and she asked many questions about our customs and culture while the children played together as if they'd known each other for years.

The friendships taught Amelie important lessons about perspective. She would ask me about Ukraine, and I explained that their situation was unfortunately worse than ours. "At least in our country there is peace," I told her, "and we can eventually return." This helped her understand that displacement comes in many forms, that temporary separation from home is a blessing compared to permanent exile from a country at war.

But perhaps most importantly, these friendships coincided with Amelie's remarkable personal growth during our time in Rotterdam. Her teacher made this growth explicit, telling us that initially it had been very hard to communicate with Amelie because she wouldn't make eye contact and would respond very softly, if at all. But over time, that changed completely.

This transformation reflected a crucial cultural difference between Aruba and the Netherlands. In Aruba, there's much more of a hierarchy between children and adults—kids don't easily talk to grown-ups, maintaining respectful distance. In the Netherlands, children are expected to interact more as equals with adults. Amelie's confidence grew considerably, and she lost much of the shyness she'd had at first. This served her well when we returned to Aruba, where she retained this newfound boldness in appropriate ways.

### Discovering joy in crisis

While Amelie was finding her place in Rotterdam's international classroom, I was discovering my own unexpected connection to the city through football. I had lived in Rotterdam as a student twenty years earlier but had never really considered myself a Feyenoord fan. During our intense months in the Ronald McDonald House, I was too busy to follow football at all.

Then I heard the news: Feyenoord was champions for the first time in years! There would be a celebration in the city center. I told Amelie, "Let's have a look. This is such a historic moment for the city, and it's quite unique that we get a chance to experience it."

We walked around the city center on foot, and the whole city was full of fans and happiness—people singing, celebrating, pure joy everywhere. It was a wonderful little escape from our hospital-centered existence, a chance to feel happiness for the city and its people rather than constantly worrying about our own situation. After that day, Amelie considered herself a Feyenoord fan.

What I didn't know at the time was how deeply embedded Feyenoord was in the Erasmus Medical Center ecosystem. In the birth center, there was a large framed picture of Giovanni van Bronckhorst right in front of our room. Downstairs in the Sophia Kinderziekenhuis, there was an entire Feyenoord area with large posters and memorabilia.

Because of their partnership with the hospital, we were offered free tickets to watch a match. I went with Amelie and two kids from our Aruban friends' families. That match turned out to be one of the most emotional experiences of our entire Rotterdam journey. Before the game started, several children from Erasmus hospital walked onto the field carrying flags—and I had to fight back tears seeing these kids who had overcome such tremendous odds.

Then the announcer said loudly that the game was dedicated to the children of the Sophia Kinderziekenhuis. The entire hardcore fan section—hundreds of people—turned their backs to the field and sang a song out of respect to us hospital families. The gesture was so touching, so unexpected, that I could barely contain my emotions.

As the season progressed and I started following Feyenoord religiously, I felt really connected emotionally. Every triumph felt like a personal win. It made those otherwise monotonous nights in Rotterdam much more exciting when I knew Feyenoord would be playing.

During this period, I developed a particular connection to Santiago Gimenez, Feyenoord's star striker. Whenever he scored he would go to his knees, point his two fingers at the sky, and look up to thank God. This gesture meant everything to me. I sent him an Instagram message trying to explain that every time he scored and thanked God, he made me as a parent of a sick child, and many others like me, forget our sorrows for a moment. When he thanked God, we celebrated that goal like it was our own achievement. If he could score, maybe we could overcome our odds too.

### Creative processing

During breaks from Neo's care, I found an unexpected outlet in painting. I created what I came to call my "resilience series"—three paintings that reflected different aspects of our experience and my evolving understanding of adaptive capacity.

The first painting depicted a comcomber chikito (wild cucumber) next to an Aruban florin coin. This indigenous plant, likely brought to the Caribbean by enslaved Africans, had largely disappeared from local cultivation despite being perfectly adapted to our semi-arid climate. The painting represented the trade-off between traditional knowledge and modern economic incentives—the cucumber depicted larger than the coin to suggest its value extends well beyond monetary terms.

My second painting focused on the inner structure of a nautilus shell, based on the Fibonacci sequence and logarithmic spirals. This represented biomimicry for economics—how natural systems offer insights for solving complex human problems. The shell's chambers provide redundancy: if one is compromised, the nautilus can seal it off and continue functioning.

The third painting, "Banana Kingdom," reflected on the irony of Dutch Caribbean islands being called a "banana republic" by winning Dutch politicians. If the Kingdom was a banana plant, I envisioned the islands as elegant flowers forming a cluster gracefully attached to the main stem—hoping for the islands' human capital to reach its full potential.

These paintings provided both creative outlet and intellectual framework for processing our experience. There was always a work in progress in our living room during those final months—a visual reminder that we were creating something meaningful from our displacement.

### Working within systems

My professional situation required creative adaptation throughout our stay. When the crisis hit, I informed key clients about our situation. The director of Aruba's Crisis Management Office proved amazing. "I always say, never change a winning team," he told me. "Maybe we just need to accommodate you a role you can carry out regardless of where you are." He kept me on as the consultant in charge of reporting—providing steady cashflow throughout the project with minimal time demands.

Similarly, Eric Mijts at the University of Aruba quickly agreed to let me continue a food security research project remotely. After I delivered successfully despite my circumstances, Eric and I developed a friendship based on mutual respect—he respected my determination to overcome difficulties and deliver as promised.

But the few disagreements we had during our Rotterdam year were telling. When I saw an opportunity to complete required PhD coursework in Amsterdam—a practical use of our unexpected presence in the Netherlands—Lay experienced this as abandonment. Even spending half-days on coursework felt like betrayal of our crisis solidarity. These moments revealed that while crisis had unified us against external threats, it hadn't resolved our different approaches to balancing personal development with family commitment.

The institutional arrangements required constant improvisation. Our health insurance proved remarkably lenient about timeline uncertainty—basically, we knew we would have the apartment until doctors at Erasmus determined we could return. The administrative complexities of temporary residency proved exhausting. I had to register in the Netherlands to get health insurance so Amelie could see a dentist and get glasses she desperately needed for school. But this registration cost considerable money in Dutch taxation for just a few months of residency—another hidden cost of seeking protection outside your home system.

### The question arrives

The daily rhythm of life in Rotterdam had settled into something approaching normalcy by the time Neo was finally stable enough to live with us in the apartment rather than the hospital. We had routines—Amelie's school, Neo's feeding schedule, my remote work, Lay's careful tracking of his progress. The initial adrenaline of crisis had long faded, replaced by the steady work of managing a medically complex child while living temporarily in a foreign country.

It was on one of those surprisingly warm autumn afternoons—the kind of day that reminded you Aruba wasn't impossibly far away—that Amelie's patience finally reached its limit. We were walking home from school through Rotterdam's wide, modern streets, both of us enjoying the unexpected sunshine. But I could tell from her posture that something was weighing on her.

"This girl in my class," she said softly, "she was being really bossy, and when I tried to help with something, she just shouted 'Boeit me niet!' really loudly."

I squeezed her hand. The Dutch directness that adults found refreshing could feel harsh to a seven-year-old accustomed to Caribbean social rhythms. We walked in comfortable silence for a few more blocks, our footsteps echoing off Rotterdam's wide, modern streets.

Then, in that same soft voice she used when she already knew the answer might disappoint her, Amelie asked: "Papa, when are we going back to Aruba?"

I couldn't look at her at first. The moment has come, I thought. It could have come much sooner. Of course you want to go back. You totally deserve it. I let her question sink in for a few seconds before turning to look her in the eye.

"I don't know, sweetheart," I said honestly. "You know it depends on when the doctor tells us Neo is ready. When he does his fit-to-fly test. But I certainly hope the time will come soon."

This conversation represented something new in our family dynamic. Throughout our crisis, I had begun talking to Amelie almost like a grown-up, sharing my vulnerabilities in ways I never had before. I told her when I felt anxious about Neo, when I was scared, when I felt like I didn't have control. For me, it was revolutionary—letting her see me as human rather than just the strong father figure who had all the answers.

The question came up multiple times over the following weeks, but Amelie was never pushy about it. She understood that we all wanted to go back, that we were doing our best to get there. She had been so strong for so long, adapting to Rotterdam with a grace that amazed me daily. But underneath that strength was a little girl who missed her friends, her school, her bedroom, her life.

Her question crystallized the central challenge we all faced: How do you adapt enough to survive in temporary circumstances without losing your essential identity or commitment to eventual return?

### Finding the balance point

As Neo's condition improved and we could see the light at the end of the tunnel, we decided to wait until January to return. Lay wanted to complete the calendar year in Holland, ensuring we could celebrate Neo's first birthday in March back home on Aruba. We spent Christmas and New Year's full of anticipation, knowing we would soon leave this experience behind.

Those holidays were actually magical in their own way. Lay's mother stayed with us throughout, giving us the precious gift of having extended family close during such an important time. Neo was doing well, we were already starting to pack, and the mood was definitively temporary—let's make the most of this unique Christmas in the Netherlands.

The Feyenoord story reached its perfect conclusion on the day we were finally discharged. I was telling the lady who organized events at the hospital that today we were finally going home with our baby.

"Oh," she said, "well, are you here around noon still? Because the Feyenoord team is coming to present the championship trophy."

Of all days—today they were coming? We stayed until 3 PM, put Neo in his Feyenoord clothes, and waited until they arrived with the trophy. I told them, "My son is being discharged today, so it's only fitting that you bring the trophy, because he's a real champion too!"

When the fit-to-fly test finally came, passing it felt like crossing a finish line we'd been racing toward for months. I decided to keep our return date secret from my parents so we could surprise them with the baby. The plan worked perfectly. After months of crisis, uncertainty, and adaptation, we finally had an unqualified moment of pure joy.

### What we learned

Living in the interim taught us that resilience often requires developing parallel systems rather than choosing between alternatives. We couldn't fully commit to Dutch life, but we couldn't simply wait for return either. Instead, we had to create hybrid arrangements that honored both our temporary status and our immediate needs.

This unexpected source of community—through Feyenoord, through Amelie's international friendships, through the profound humanity of Dr. Wijsman's transformation—taught me something crucial about adaptation: sometimes the most meaningful connections emerge from the most unlikely circumstances.

The key insight was learning to find stability within motion rather than waiting for motion to stop. True adaptation means building frameworks flexible enough to accommodate uncertainty while maintaining enough structure to sustain daily life.

Sometimes resilience isn't about solving the adaptation dilemma but about learning to live productively within it. We had adapted enough to thrive temporarily without losing ourselves permanently. And in that balance, we discovered capacities we never knew we had.

But what we couldn't yet see was how the very success of our temporary adaptation was creating new vulnerabilities we'd only recognize once we returned home.
