## Chapter 6: The Adaptation Dilemma

### Sophie's question

The weather was surprisingly warm for Rotterdam in late autumn—not that different from a mild day in Aruba, actually. I was holding Sophie's hand as we walked home from school, both of us enjoying the unexpected sunshine. But I could tell from her posture that the day hadn't gone well.

"This girl in my class," she said softly, "she was being really bossy, and when I tried to help with something, she just shouted 'Boeit me niet!' really loudly."

I squeezed her hand. The Dutch directness that adults found refreshing could feel harsh to a seven-year-old accustomed to Caribbean social rhythms. We walked in comfortable silence for a few more blocks, our footsteps echoing off the narrow Rotterdam streets.

Then, in that same soft voice she used when she already knew the answer might disappoint her, Sophie asked: "Papa, when are we going back to Aruba?"

I couldn't look at her at first. The moment has come, I thought. It could have come much sooner. Of course you want to go back. You totally deserve it. And I wish I could grant you your wish. I let her question sink in for a few seconds before turning to look her in the eye.

"I don't know, sweetheart," I said honestly. "You know it depends on when the doctor tells us Neo is ready. When he does his fit-to-fly test. But I certainly hope the time will come soon."

This conversation represented something new in our family dynamic. Throughout our crisis, I had begun talking to Sophie almost like a grown-up, sharing my vulnerabilities in ways I never had before. I told her when I felt anxious about Neo, when I was scared, when I felt like I didn't have control. For me, it was revolutionary—letting her see me as human rather than just the strong father figure who had all the answers.

The question came up multiple times over the following weeks, but Sophie was never pushy about it. She understood that we all wanted to go back, that we were doing our best to get there. She had been so strong for so long, adapting to Rotterdam with a grace that amazed me daily. But underneath that strength was a little girl who missed her friends, her school, her bedroom, her life.

As Neo's condition improved and we could see the light at the end of the tunnel, we decided to wait until January to return. Elena wanted to complete the calendar year in Holland, ensuring we could celebrate Neo's first birthday in March back home on Aruba. We spent Christmas and New Year's full of anticipation, knowing we would soon leave this experience behind.

Those holidays were actually magical in their own way. Elena's mother stayed with us throughout, giving us the precious gift of having extended family close during such an important time. Neo was doing well, we were already starting to pack, and the mood was definitively temporary—let's make the most of this unique Christmas in the Netherlands. I focused on cooking Aruban food for the holidays, while family visited from Leiden and Den Haag. My sister and her husband, Elena's sister Kate—we had a proper Caribbean Christmas gathering in our Rotterdam apartment.

New Year's Eve felt particularly symbolic: "This is the year we're going back home to Aruba!" New beginnings, indeed.

When the fit-to-fly test finally came, passing it felt like crossing a finish line we'd been racing toward for months. The anticipation had been building, but when we got the official clearance, the relief was overwhelming. We were really going home.

I decided to keep our return date secret from my parents so we could surprise them with the baby. I coordinated with my sister and brother to maintain the secret, and arranged with a good friend to pick us up from the airport. The plan was to arrive at our house—which sits next door to my parents—from the opposite direction, being very quiet until we could properly surprise them.

To throw my mother off the scent, I even sent her a picture while we were on the train from Rotterdam to the airport, timing it so she would see the image when she woke up and assume we were still in the Netherlands, never imagining that by then we were already somewhere over the Atlantic.

The surprise worked perfectly. After months of crisis, uncertainty, and adaptation, we finally had an unqualified moment of pure joy.

### Finding community among the displaced

Before that homecoming, though, Sophie had to navigate the challenge of building friendships with children who understood displacement. She told me about two Ukrainian girls in her class—Vara, who had been there when Sophie started, and Yeva, who arrived after summer break when Sophie was beginning her second school year in Rotterdam.

When I met Vara's mother at school, I discovered they weren't typical refugees. This was a professional family, high-skilled migrants who had moved because of the war but were considered expats rather than asylum seekers. Still, the children shared something profound with Sophie: the sudden experience of being in a strange country, having to start a new life overnight.

What touched me most was watching Sophie help Yeva when she arrived. After months of being the new girl herself, Sophie finally got to experience helping someone else feel comfortable. "You're Ukrainian too?" she said, introducing Yeva to Vara. "Come meet my friend."

Yeva was a bit older and more mature, and in the end, Sophie connected better with her than with Vara. But they all remained friends, creating a small international community within the Dutch classroom.

The cultural mixing was perhaps most evident at Sophie's birthday party. Elena organized it at a party venue, which proved challenging with transportation, especially on a night when it was raining hard. Sophie and Elena got soaked taking public transport to get there, while I waited for our friends to pick up me and Neo.

But kids are remarkably adaptable. The Aruban children from our friends' families—six kids in total from three different families—mixed easily with the Ukrainian girls. For Yeva's mother, everything about Aruba was completely unknown, and she asked many questions about our customs and culture while the children played together as if they'd known each other for years.

The friendships taught Sophie important lessons about perspective. She would ask me about Ukraine, and I explained that their situation was unfortunately worse than ours. "At least in our country there is peace," I told her, "and we can eventually return." This helped her understand that displacement comes in many forms, that temporary separation from home is a blessing compared to permanent exile from a country at war.

But perhaps most importantly, these friendships coincided with Sophie's remarkable personal growth during our time in Rotterdam. Her teacher made this growth explicit, telling us that initially it had been very hard to communicate with Sophie because she wouldn't make eye contact and would respond very softly, if at all. But over time, that changed completely, and the teacher was relieved to see her really open up.

This transformation reflected a crucial cultural difference between Aruba and the Netherlands. In Aruba, there's much more of a hierarchy between children and adults—kids don't easily talk to grown-ups, maintaining respectful distance. In the Netherlands, children are expected to interact more as equals with adults. Sophie's confidence grew considerably, and she lost much of the shyness she'd had at first. This served her well when we returned to Aruba, where she retained this newfound boldness in appropriate ways.

### Feyenoord: discovering joy in crisis

While Sophie was finding her place in Rotterdam's international classroom, I was discovering my own unexpected connection to the city through football. I had lived in Rotterdam as a student twenty years earlier but had never really considered myself a Feyenoord fan. During our intense months in the Ronald McDonald House, I was too busy to follow football at all.

Then I heard the news: Feyenoord was champions for the first time in years! There would be a celebration in the city center. I told Sophie, "Let's have a look. This is such a historic moment for the city, and it's quite unique that we get a chance to experience it."

We walked around the city center on foot, and the whole city was full of fans and happiness—people singing, celebrating, pure joy everywhere. It was a wonderful little escape from our hospital-centered existence, a chance to feel happiness for the city and its people rather than constantly worrying about our own situation. The experience left quite an impression on Sophie. After that day, she considered herself a Feyenoord fan.

What I didn't know at the time was how deeply embedded Feyenoord was in the Erasmus Medical Center ecosystem. In the birth center, where we stayed the first nights after Neo's birth, there was a large framed picture of Giovanni van Bronckhorst right in front of our room. Downstairs in the Sophia Kinderziekenhuis, there was an entire Feyenoord area with large posters and memorabilia.

The connection went beyond decoration. Because of their partnership with the hospital, we were offered free tickets to watch a match. I went with Sophie and two kids from our Aruban friends' families who were into football—one of them was trying hard to go professional at fourteen.

That match turned out to be one of the most emotional experiences of our entire Rotterdam journey. We sat in a separate section above where the most passionate fans stood. Before the game started, several children from Erasmus hospital walked onto the field carrying flags—and I had to fight back tears seeing these kids who had overcome such tremendous odds.

Then the announcer said loudly that the game was dedicated to the children of the Sophia Kinderziekenhuis. The entire hardcore fan section—hundreds of people—turned their backs to the field and sang a song out of respect to us hospital families. The gesture was so touching, so unexpected, that I could barely contain my emotions.

Before the match, Sophie and I got matching Feyenoord jackets that we still wear occasionally when it rains or when we go to the cinema. She loves her Feyenoord jacket, a tangible reminder of finding joy during our darkest period.

As the season progressed and I started following Feyenoord religiously, I felt really connected emotionally. Every triumph felt like a personal win. It made those otherwise monotonous nights in Rotterdam much more exciting when I knew Feyenoord would be playing. I got Neo a Feyenoord pacifier, Feyenoord baby clothes, and even made a little Instagram video with a Feyenoord song: "Feyenoord, wat gaan wij doen vandaag? Wij gaan winnen!"

During this period, I developed a particular connection to Santiago Gimenez, Feyenoord's star striker. Whenever he scored he would go to his knees, point his two fingers at the sky, and look up to thank God. This gesture meant everything to me. He lived in the building opposite the Maas River from the hospital, and from his apartment, he could see the hospital building.

I sent him an Instagram message—which never received a response—trying to explain that if he could only imagine how football can be so much bigger than just the game. Every time he scored and thanked God, he made me as a parent of a sick child, and many others like me, forget our sorrows for a moment. When he thanked God, we celebrated that goal like it was our own achievement. If he could score, maybe we could overcome our odds too. It gave hope. It was so much more than just a game.

The Feyenoord story reached its perfect conclusion on the day we were finally discharged. I was talking to the lady who organized events at the hospital for families—we had participated in various activities, including a fundraising run—and telling her that today we were finally going home with our baby.

"Oh," she said, "well, are you here around noon still? Because the Feyenoord team is coming to present the championship trophy."

Of all days—today they were coming? We were supposed to leave in the morning, but I rushed to explain to Elena that we couldn't miss this, and to the nursing staff that we needed to stay until 3 PM.

We put Neo in his Feyenoord clothes and waited in the common area until they arrived with the trophy. Unfortunately, the coaching staff came rather than the players, but it was still meaningful. I told them, "My son is being discharged today, so it's only fitting that you bring the trophy, because he's a real champion too!" We took lovely pictures that were posted on the hospital's social media—a perfect ending to our Feyenoord journey.

This unexpected source of joy taught me something crucial about resilience: sometimes the most meaningful connections emerge from the most unlikely circumstances. We hadn't come to Rotterdam to become football fans, but discovering this community gave us a sense of belonging that went far beyond our medical crisis.

### The economics of temporary thinking

While my family wrestled with Sophie's question about when we'd return home, Caribbean governments were facing remarkably similar dilemmas about post-COVID recovery. Across the region, the prevailing assumption was that the tourism shutdown was temporary, that the goal was simply to wait for visitors to return to pre-pandemic levels.

This proved to be a costly miscalculation. According to Caribbean Tourism Organization data, regional tourism arrivals fell by over 70% in 2020, with some islands experiencing even steeper declines. Aruba saw visitor arrivals drop from 1.1 million in 2019 to just 432,000 in 2020. The Bahamas fell from 7.2 million to 1.8 million visitors. Barbados dropped from 681,000 to 196,000.

Yet rather than using this unprecedented disruption as an opportunity for economic transformation, most islands simply waited. Diversification efforts were minimal—some investments in hydroponic food production, but nothing comparable to the scale of the tourism industry that had been lost.

The "temporary" mindset was perhaps most evident in Aruba's "Re-start conversation" webinar series, which was broadcast nationally during the lockdown period. I participated in these discussions, arguing that this was an opportunity to apply Winston Churchill's advice: "Never waste a good crisis!" We could re-imagine Aruba's economy, focusing on economic activities not subject to the same vulnerabilities as tourism.

But we did end up wasting the crisis nevertheless. The allure of familiar patterns proved too strong. When tourism began recovering in 2021 and 2022, any appetite for fundamental economic restructuring evaporated. Islands that had been forced to confront their over-dependence on a single industry quickly returned to that same dependence as soon as visitors started returning.

This pattern mirrors what I observed in government responses to climate change—another slow-moving crisis that struggles to register as a top priority when there are always more acute competing demands. Unlike a pandemic that shuts down economies overnight, climate change operates on timescales that make adaptation feel less urgent than immediate recovery.

The psychological parallels to our family situation were striking. Just as Sophie's question "When are we going back?" reflected our deep assumption that this was temporary, Caribbean governments approached COVID-19 as a disruption to be endured rather than a catalyst for transformation. The blessing of knowing our situation was temporary—unlike other families forced into permanent relocation—meant we could focus on adaptation strategies rather than fundamental life changes.

But for Small Island Developing States facing rising sea levels, increasing hurricane intensity, and persistent economic volatility, the luxury of temporary thinking may be a dangerous delusion. When I consider that I felt relieved to be rejected for all three jobs I applied for in the Netherlands—because accepting work might have tempted us to stay permanently—I recognize how powerful the pull of familiar patterns can be, even when transformation might offer better long-term prospects.

The danger lies in treating transformational challenges as temporary disruptions. Islands that keep waiting for tourism to return to 2019 levels may miss opportunities to build more resilient economic foundations. Just as our family had to balance hope for return with preparation for extended adaptation, Caribbean economies need frameworks that can simultaneously preserve what works while transforming what doesn't.

### Living in the interim

The daily rhythm of life in Rotterdam required constant navigation between temporary and permanent thinking. Our days were surprisingly busy despite minimal work commitments. Neo's care dominated our schedule—feeding was particularly time-consuming because he was always either about to eat, eating, or recovering from eating. The complex process of weaning him from the feeding tube required constant attention and careful documentation.

During the early NICU period I managed the breast milk supply chain like a military operation—collecting sterile bottles, labeling, rotating stock between three locations. Elena tracked Neo's tolerance, watching for signs of reflux, documenting every reaction. We were both analytical, both systematic, but operating in parallel rather than together.

"Second freezer batch is full," I'd report. "Moving to apartment storage tomorrow."

"He's keeping it down better today," she'd respond. "No spit-up after the noon feed."

We exchanged information like shift workers at changeover—efficient, thorough, but mechanical.

By the time Elena started her weaning spreadsheet, Neo had been on formula for months. My milk logistics role had long ended. Now I watched her build her case for getting him off the feeding tube entirely, tracking oral intake against weight gain, finding patterns the medical team couldn't see.

"Remember when you used to transport all that breast milk on your bicycle?" she said one evening, looking up from her data.

"In the snow. With bags hanging from both handles."

"You looked insane." She almost smiled. "But you never missed a delivery."

"We were a good team," I said.

"Were," she repeated quietly, returning to her spreadsheet.

Sophie's school schedule provided important structure, but it also highlighted the awkwardness of our temporary status. The Rotterdam school system proved remarkably accommodating to children coming and going—apparently this was common enough that they had developed flexible approaches. There was less emphasis on academic performance and attendance requirements compared to Aruba. Students advanced regardless of their results, which sometimes made us wonder if this was really in Sophie's best interest.

During breaks from Neo's care, I found an unexpected outlet in painting. I created what I came to call my "resilience series"—three paintings that reflected different aspects of our experience and my evolving understanding of adaptive capacity.

The first painting depicted a comcomber chikito (wild cucumber) next to an Aruban florin coin. This indigenous plant, likely brought to the Caribbean by enslaved Africans, had largely disappeared from local cultivation despite being perfectly adapted to our semi-arid climate. The painting represented the trade-off between traditional knowledge and modern economic incentives—the cucumber depicted larger than the coin to suggest its value extends well beyond monetary terms. It was about reconnecting to indigenous knowledge, promoting health, environmental stewardship, and ultimately building economic resilience.

My second painting focused on the inner structure of a nautilus shell, based on the Fibonacci sequence and logarithmic spirals. This represented biomimicry for economics—how natural systems offer insights for solving complex human problems. The shell's chambers provide redundancy: if one is compromised, the nautilus can seal it off and continue functioning. The painting explored whether we allocate resources judiciously enough to continue operating even in the face of disruptions.

The third painting, "Banana Kingdom," reflected on the irony of Dutch Caribbean islands being called a "banana republic" by winning Dutch politicians. If the Kingdom was a banana plant, I envisioned the islands as elegant flowers forming a cluster gracefully attached to the main stem—hoping for the islands' human capital to reach its full potential rather than being dismissed as peripheral territories.

These paintings provided both creative outlet and intellectual framework for processing our experience. There was always a work in progress in our living room during those final months—a visual reminder that we were creating something meaningful from our displacement.

The institutional arrangements required constant improvisation. Our health insurance proved remarkably lenient about timeline uncertainty—basically, we knew we would have the apartment until doctors at Erasmus determined we could return. The only pressure I felt was my desire to have a fixed departure date in advance so I could arrange flights and other logistics, but this proved "too much to ask" given medical uncertainties.

My work situation required the most creative adaptation. When the crisis hit, I informed key clients about our situation. The director of Aruba's Crisis Management Office, where I was supposed to lead implementation of the Early Warning System, proved amazing. "I always say, never change a winning team," he told me, "and we had good experiences with Cornerstone Economics in the past. Maybe we just need to accommodate you a role you can carry out regardless of where you are."

He kept me on as the consultant in charge of MEAL reporting—providing steady cashflow throughout the project with minimal time demands. We even met for dinner twice when he visited the Netherlands on business. This flexibility proved essential to our family's financial stability during the crisis.

Similarly, Eric Mijts at the University of Aruba quickly agreed to let me continue a food security research project remotely. This was a collaboration between universities in Aruba, Sint Maarten, and Curaçao, and while the other researchers gave me grief about availability, Eric provided unwavering support. We met for coffee where I had a very open conversation about the struggles I was going through, and I committed to deliver despite my circumstances. By the project's end, I had over-delivered significantly compared to my colleagues, despite my personal situation. Eric and I developed a friendship based on mutual respect—I respected him for believing in me and supporting me throughout, while he respected my determination to overcome difficulties and deliver as promised.

### Personal ambitions versus family solidarity

The few disagreements we had during our Rotterdam year were telling. When I saw an opportunity to complete required PhD coursework in Amsterdam—a practical use of our unexpected presence in the Netherlands—Elena experienced this as abandonment. 'There he goes, choosing personal glory again,' was her response to what I thought was efficient time management. Even spending half-days on coursework felt like betrayal of our crisis solidarity. I felt guilty for 'choosing myself' even briefly, but also resentful that practical decisions were being interpreted through the lens of our pre-crisis relationship patterns. These moments revealed that while crisis had unified us against external threats, it hadn't resolved our different approaches to balancing personal development with family commitment.

The contrast was stark: professional colleagues like Eric understood that maintaining some career momentum during crisis was practical and necessary. But    , we faced a maze of administrative challenges that seemed designed to exhaust displaced families.

The administrative complexities of temporary residency proved exhausting. I had to register in the Netherlands to get health insurance so Sophie could see a dentist and get glasses she desperately needed for school. But this registration was both necessary and unhandy, since we expected to leave within months. It cost considerable money in Dutch taxation for just a few months of residency—another hidden cost of seeking protection outside your home system.

Living in the interim taught us that resilience often requires developing parallel systems rather than choosing between alternatives. We couldn't fully commit to Dutch life, but we couldn't simply wait for return either. Instead, we had to create hybrid arrangements that honored both our temporary status and our immediate needs.

This experience offered important insights for Small Island Developing States facing prolonged uncertainty. Climate change, economic volatility, and other persistent challenges require similar hybrid approaches—maintaining core systems while developing adaptive capacity, preserving essential functions while remaining open to transformation.

The key insight was learning to find stability within motion rather than waiting for motion to stop. True adaptation means building frameworks flexible enough to accommodate uncertainty while maintaining enough structure to sustain daily life. Sometimes resilience isn't about solving the adaptation dilemma but about learning to live productively within it.
