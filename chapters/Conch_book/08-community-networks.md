## Chapter 8: Community Networks

During those first months after Neo's birth, while we were still learning to navigate the NICU systems and medical protocols I described earlier, the Ronald McDonald House became our temporary home and introduced us to an entirely different kind of resilience—one based not on individual adaptation but on collective recognition of shared vulnerability.

### The village of the vulnerable

The Ronald McDonald House sits directly adjacent to the Sophia Kinderziekenhuis, connected by a covered walkway that becomes a lifeline for families navigating the longest nights of their lives. For three months, this became our temporary home—a peculiar village populated entirely by people whose children hovered between life and death.

Each morning began the same way: the soft shuffle of exhausted parents making their way to the communal kitchen on the second floor, preparing breakfast before heading across that covered bridge to spend another day hoping for good news. The kitchen conversations were muted, respectful—everyone understood that any parent might have received devastating news just hours before. Yet in this space of shared vulnerability, something remarkable happened: a community formed around the simple recognition that we were all fighting the same impossible odds.

I tried to draw Lay into these morning rhythms, but she'd participate minimally before retreating to our room. "That mother from Turkey has a son with similar complications," I'd mention after chatting in the communal kitchen. "Maybe you could—"

"I'm not here to make friends," she'd say quietly. "I just want Neo to get better."

While I found myself comparing treatment protocols with other fathers, including a wonderful man from Curaçao with whom I could speak Papiamento in the communal kitchen—a precious connection to home amid the medical crisis—Lay built walls. She'd care for Neo with fierce dedication but avoided the informal support networks that sustained other families. Even in crisis, she remained intensely private, sharing her fears with no one—not even me.

"You talk to everyone," she said once, not quite an accusation.

"It helps to know we're not alone in this."

"We are alone," she replied. "These people don't know us."

The community was predominantly Dutch—families from across the Netherlands whose children needed specialized care—but it struck me how representative they were of Dutch society itself. "It seems like a very representative sample of Dutch parents," I commented to Lay one morning after observing the breakfast crowd. "Maybe because medical conditions don't discriminate by social class." You had wealthy families alongside those who were clearly struggling financially, occasional immigrant families, the rare international case like ours—a cross-section united only by the shared vulnerability of having critically ill children.

The volunteer staff possessed an almost supernatural understanding of what we were going through. I watched them clean up after parents who had left dirty dishes in the sink, knowing that person's mind was consumed by their child's crisis two floors above us. They understood that courtesy might temporarily disappear when your child was dying. They absorbed occasional harsh words or complaints with endless patience, recognizing that the anger wasn't really directed at them but at the unfairness of life itself.

Lay moved through these communal spaces like a ghost. While I collected phone numbers and treatment tips from other parents, she perfected the art of being present but unreachable. She'd nod politely when others tried to engage, then disappear. Other mothers learned not to approach her.

"That woman is so strong," one father told me, mistaking her isolation for strength. "Never breaks down, never complains."

I didn't correct him. How could I explain that her strength was actually a wall, that she shared nothing because trusting others—even me—felt too dangerous?

But perhaps most remarkable was how the broader community embraced this temporary village. Every few weeks, a notice would appear in the elevator: "Next Friday you're invited to dinner"—sometimes organized by a local company whose employees would come cook, sometimes by a church group, sometimes by families who had once been residents themselves. These dinners were open invitations to bring friends or family, transforming the weight of hospital visits into opportunities for connection and normalcy.

The dinner I remember most vividly was organized by a young couple who had lost their baby three years earlier. Every year, they returned with their extended family to cook for current residents—their way of honoring their daughter's memory while supporting other families walking the path they had traveled. When I spoke with the father, learning about their tradition, I felt moved to share our small victory: Neo had just reached the milestone where I could take him, oxygen tank and all, out of the NICU for brief visits.

Lay had stayed in our room that evening, uncomfortable with the communal grieving and celebration. But I brought Neo to meet them. The young mother's reaction was immediate and raw—seeing our baby brought back the full weight of their loss, and she began crying. I found myself crying too, wondering if I had made a terrible mistake parading our fragile hope in front of their grief. Yet somehow, in that moment of shared tears, I understood this was part of their healing process—that hope and loss are not opposites but intimate companions in the geography of crisis.

### The bonds of shared risk

Our daily rhythms created unexpected connections—at least for me. There was the family from Curaçao whose children quickly bonded with Amelie over shared language and the simple joy of finding other kids in this adult world of medical crisis. When Lay organized an Easter egg hunt in the small park beside the hospital, these children joined Amelie—a moment of normal childhood celebration amid the antiseptic reality of the NICU. It was one of the few community activities Lay initiated, and only because it was for Amelie, not for herself.

We met Marieke on Neo's second day of life, when her daughter Emma was born just a few days earlier, also with CDH. Our babies lay in opposite corners of the same NICU room, and we found ourselves tracking each other's progress like markers on parallel journeys. I exchanged updates with Marieke regularly, comparing treatment approaches and milestone achievements. Lay would listen to my reports but rarely engaged with Marieke directly, maintaining her careful distance even from someone walking an identical path.

In those early days, Neo faced more severe complications—more surgeries, more uncertainty. Later, our paths diverged: Neo's issues resolved while Emma continued struggling with feeding complications, requiring a gastric tube that followed them home. Even after we returned to Aruba, I saw through social media that Emma faced repeated hospitalizations and setbacks. The randomness felt almost cruel—similar conditions, similar protections, vastly different outcomes.

Then there was the family whose teenage daughter lay in the windowed room we could see from the NICU. The walls around her bed were covered with colorful drawings from her school friends—get-well wishes from classmates who remembered her as a healthy basketball player just weeks before. A flu had turned septic, causing severe brain damage that left her unable to speak or control her movements. Her mother maintained a grace that astounded me, caring for this daughter while coordinating care for three other children at home, supported by grandparents who had essentially taken over the household.

I would share these stories with Lay, hoping they might provide perspective or comfort. But she would listen silently, processing everything internally. "Why do you need to know everyone's tragedy?" she asked once. "Isn't ours enough?"

The basketball team led fundraising efforts. The school organized support campaigns. Yet none of this community mobilization could change the fundamental reality of her condition. It could only surround the family with love while they learned to navigate their new normal.

### The cruelest mathematics

But it was Jaap who taught me the most profound lesson about the mathematics of crisis. I first noticed him during breakfast preparation—a tall Dutch man who worked quietly on his laptop in the common area. When I had a job interview via video call, sitting in that same space, he couldn't help but overhear my explanation to potential employers about our situation—the uncertainty about whether we could return to Aruba, my need for work options if we had to stay in the Netherlands permanently.

After the call, Jaap approached me. He was also looking for new work, he explained—something more flexible that would allow him to support his wife through their own medical crisis. His baby had been born extremely premature with severe lung complications, and the prognosis was deteriorating. He offered linguistic advice for my Dutch job applications, correcting my word choices and metaphors with the gentle precision of someone who understood that we were both trying to build lifelines for uncertain futures.

Our kitchen encounters became brief check-ins on our children's progress. Each time I asked about his baby, Jaap's responses grew more somber. "Not doing well... the prospects aren't good." Then, visibly emotional: "It's just a matter of time now. The lung capacity isn't sufficient. We're just enjoying every day as a gift."

Lay never met Jaap. She had no idea who he was beyond my mentions of "that Dutch father whose baby is struggling." Her world had shrunk to our room, Neo's NICU bay, and the corridor between them.

The last time I saw Jaap was in the elevator. When I asked how things were going, he simply said: "It's over. The baby just passed away. We're packing our stuff and going home now." He started crying—this big Dutch man breaking down in front of someone he barely knew.

Jaap was a massive man—easily a head taller than me, with broad shoulders and the kind of physical presence that normally commanded respect in any room. But in that small elevator, he seemed to collapse inward, his large frame shaking with grief. When I reached out to hug him, it felt like embracing a wounded bear—all that size and strength rendered helpless by something no amount of physical power could fight.

His shoulders heaved as he sobbed openly, and I found myself holding this stranger whose pain was so raw it filled the entire elevator. I had never hugged a man in such a painful moment before. The awkwardness was overwhelming—what do you say to someone whose worst nightmare has just become reality? I kept repeating how sorry I was, the words feeling completely inadequate against the magnitude of his loss.

But underneath my genuine sympathy was something else, something that made me deeply uncomfortable: a twisted sense of guilt that my baby had lived while his had died. It felt unfair—not that Neo had survived, but that survival seemed so random, so cruelly arbitrary. Part of me wished we could switch places, though I knew that wasn't really true. I didn't want my baby to die, but Jaap didn't deserve this either. No parent deserved this. The randomness of it all felt like a cosmic injustice that I somehow benefited from while he suffered.

"I'm so sorry," I kept saying, feeling the inadequacy of every word. "I don't know what to say."

Jaap composed himself with typical Dutch pragmatism: "It's okay, that's how it is. Some make it, some don't." But his voice broke as he said it, and we both knew those words were just a way to get through the moment, not any real acceptance of what had happened.

When the elevator opened, he walked away with his shoulders still shaking slightly, and I stood there feeling like I had witnessed something too private, too devastating for a chance encounter between near-strangers.

Later that day, I saw them leaving—Jaap and his wife walking slowly toward the exit with their suitcases, moving like people in a dream. It reminded me, bizarrely, of those old reality shows like Big Brother, where contestants have to pack their belongings and leave when they're eliminated. Everyone gathers around looking sad, the departing person tries to be gracious about leaving the show, there are awkward hugs and promises to stay in touch. But this was real life. This was no television show.

When I told Lay about Jaap's loss that evening, she was quiet for a long moment. "You shouldn't have gotten so involved," she finally said. "Now you're carrying his grief too."

"How could I not get involved? We're all here for the same reason."

"No," she said firmly. "We're here for Neo. That's all that matters."

How do you drive home after losing your child? I found myself thinking about their journey—hours in a car together, probably in silence, with nothing but grief and empty car seats and the terrible weight of having to tell family and friends what had happened. What do you talk about during a drive like that? How do you even begin to process returning to a house that had been prepared for a baby who would never come home?

I couldn't sleep that night, haunted by the cruel mathematics of probability. Like Russian roulette, some families pack their bags and go home with their children. Others pack those same bags and leave empty-handed after weeks or months of fighting. How could such randomness determine the trajectory of entire families?

Lay slept beside me, having taken her usual sleep medication. She hadn't cried for Jaap or his wife. She hadn't wondered about their drive home. She had simply filed it away as something that happened to other people, maintaining the emotional distance that protected her from the full weight of where we were and what could happen.

In some ways, I envied her ability to compartmentalize. While I absorbed every family's story, feeling the weight of collective grief and fear, she focused solely on Neo's survival. But I also wondered what it cost her to maintain such isolation, to reject the comfort of shared experience in favor of solitary endurance.

### Perspective through shared suffering

The hospital waiting rooms became spaces where different types of human struggle intersected, creating unexpected moments of perspective that I carry with me still. During one of Neo's surgeries, we found ourselves sharing the anxious vigil with another family facing a completely different kind of crisis.

A teenage girl was undergoing surgery after a suicide attempt—a flu that had turned septic, causing severe brain damage. Her parents, clearly separated and struggling to maintain civility during their shared crisis, sat on opposite sides of the waiting room while extended family tried to bridge the tension. The awkwardness was palpable, but both sides were united in their vigil for their daughter's survival.

What haunts me most was hearing the mother say, through tears, "How do you handle a situation where the child herself doesn't want to live? She hates you as a parent for ever conceiving her and putting her into this world."

The pain in her voice was devastating. While we were fighting desperately to save our son's life, this family was grappling with a child who actively rejected the gift of existence. The contrast was stark and sobering. Here we were, hoping and praying and doing everything possible to give Neo the chance to live, while down the hall, a family watched their daughter recover from her attempt to end the life they had given her.

This encounter put our struggle into sharp perspective. Our fight was against biological limitations and medical complications—external threats to a child who wanted to live. Their battle was against despair itself, against the psychological pain that could make existence feel unbearable to their daughter.

Later, a friend shared a story that deepened this understanding of perspective through suffering. Her son had died of cancer at a young age—just married, working on finishing his PhD, fighting desperately to live and ultimately losing the battle. As a social worker at secondary schools, she found it unbearable to counsel other young people who wanted to end their lives while her own son had wished so fervently to keep his. She had to stop working for a while before she could deal with this cruel irony.

These encounters revealed how shared vulnerability in crisis creates not just community but perspective. Being surrounded by other families facing impossible odds reminded us constantly that suffering comes in many forms, that our particular crisis was just one variation in the endless catalog of human struggle. Yet this knowledge didn't diminish our pain—it contextualized it within a larger understanding of what it means to be human and fragile.

Most importantly, these encounters taught us gratitude—not the shallow gratitude of counting blessings, but the profound appreciation that comes from recognizing how many different ways life can break, and how precious it is when it doesn't.

### Islands in the storm

This randomness extends far beyond hospital walls to the islands I study professionally. Geographic location creates unavoidable differences in vulnerability among Caribbean nations. The SSS islands—Sint Maarten, Sint Eustatius, and Saba—lie directly in the hurricane belt, with return periods measured in years rather than decades. They live with the constant awareness that the next major hurricane is not a matter of if but when. The ABC islands—Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao—sit south of the typical hurricane tracks, fostering a collective mentality that "it will never happen here, so why prepare?"

This difference in risk perception shapes everything from building codes to disaster preparedness investments to insurance participation. During a World Bank conference on Aruba, organized jointly with the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility, I watched policymakers dismiss parametric insurance products as unnecessary expenses. "Why should we pay premiums for something that won't happen to us?" they argued. "These products only benefit the islands with higher risk in the pooling arrangement."

Yet when Hurricane Irma devastated Sint Maarten in 2017, the response from the southern islands was immediate and heartfelt. Aruba's Prime Minister personally flew to Sint Maarten with crisis management specialists. Collections of food, clothing, and emergency supplies flowed from Aruba and Curaçao to the devastated island. Police officers were dispatched to help maintain order during the recovery. The government hosted evacuated children, and families opened their homes to relatives fleeing the disaster.

This solidarity emerged not from formal protocols but from the recognition that we are all part of the same Caribbean family, that the randomness of hurricane tracks could just as easily have reversed our positions. Like families in the Ronald McDonald House who had never met before their children fell critically ill, islands that often compete economically become immediate allies when crisis reveals our shared vulnerability.

### When shells cannot protect

The queen conch's magnificent shell, perfected over millions of years, offers no protection against the fishing nets that now threaten its existence. Similarly, conch communities that have evolved sophisticated group behaviors—coordinating movement, sharing information about predators, collectively raising young—find these social adaptations useless against industrial fishing methods that capture entire populations simultaneously.

No matter how robust the protective structure or how sophisticated the community response, novel threats can bypass even the most evolved defenses. The same principle applies to our modern vulnerabilities. Just months before our medical journey, Aruba's healthcare system was temporarily crippled when hackers held medical records for ransom—a threat that no traditional disaster planning had anticipated. Hospital staff had to revert to paper records while paying criminals for access to their own data.

These novel dangers remind us that resilience cannot rely solely on strengthening familiar protections. Like the families at Ronald McDonald House who discovered that love, community support, and medical expertise cannot guarantee outcomes, both conch communities and island nations must acknowledge that even the most comprehensive preparations cannot eliminate the fundamental randomness of which threats will emerge and when.

### The strength of shared burden

What sustained us through those three months was not the elimination of uncertainty but the recognition that we didn't face it alone. The young couple organizing annual dinners in memory of their lost daughter, the families from Curaçao who became Amelie's surrogate extended family, the volunteers who understood that kindness sometimes means cleaning up after someone whose world is falling apart—all of this created a web of support that made the unbearable weight of crisis somehow bearable.

Similarly, the Caribbean islands' response to Hurricane Irma demonstrated that resilience often emerges not from individual strength but from collective recognition of shared vulnerability. When formal insurance mechanisms and disaster preparation protocols reached their limits, it was the human networks—the family connections, cultural bonds, and regional solidarity—that provided the most meaningful support.

This is the paradox that formal resilience frameworks struggle to capture: the very randomness that makes planning impossible also creates the conditions for authentic community. Jaap and I became friends not despite our shared uncertainty but because of it. Islands support each other not when outcomes are predictable but precisely when they are not.

In the end, we cannot eliminate the cruel mathematics of probability. Some children make it home; others don't. Some islands weather the storm; others bear the full brunt of nature's power. Some conch communities survive the nets; others become casualties of human appetite. But within this randomness, communities form around the recognition that while we cannot control outcomes, we can control how we support each other through the waiting, the hoping, and sometimes the grieving.

The Ronald McDonald House taught me that resilience is not primarily about building stronger individual defenses but about creating networks of care that hold us when our own strength fails. This is perhaps the most important lesson for understanding how small islands—or any vulnerable community—can navigate an uncertain world: not by eliminating risk, but by ensuring that no one faces that risk alone.

Yet even the strongest community networks cannot accelerate the slow work of healing. As Neo faced multiple surgeries and setbacks, we learned that regeneration follows its own logic—often slower than we hoped, more complex than we expected, and never quite returning us to exactly where we started.
