## Chapter 10: Beyond Recovery

## Return to a world unchanged

Three hours before landing in Aruba, our homecoming took an unexpected turn toward crisis when Lay noticed alarming readings on the small saturation meter we had purchased to monitor Neo during the flight. The device, untested and apparently unsuited for baby fingers, showed oxygen levels well below what we expected, even accounting for the altitude-related drops we had been warned about.

What followed was a perfectly choreographed KLM medical response that revealed how thoroughly our crisis mindset had become embedded in our family dynamics. A Dutch GP on board provided reassurance after examining Neo and taking readings with the plane's equipment. But when I contacted Sophia Kinderziekenhuis via their 24-hour emergency line, their response was uncompromising: notify the pilots, request an ambulance on standby, immediate medical evaluation upon landing.

So our long-anticipated homecoming began with Lay rushing off the plane first with Neo, heading directly to yet another medical evaluation, while I struggled alone with an absurd amount of luggage that pushed every airline limit. When ground staff refused to help—"If you had required assistance, you should have indicated that before, that's not our responsibility"—I found myself becoming that obnoxious, demanding parent again, literally stepping back onto Aruban soil in exactly the same combative mode I had inhabited in Rotterdam hospitals.

By the time I reached immigration, Lay was relaxed and waiting. The medical team had quickly concluded that Neo was fine—the saturation readings had indeed been false alarms from equipment poorly designed for infant monitoring. We were cleared to finally go home.

The reception was everything we had imagined during those long months of anticipation. Lay's close friends were there with their children, creating an instant reunion for Amelie with her social circle. My stepson Shawndrick met Neo for the first time in a moment that was profoundly emotional for all of us. The warmth of community welcome felt like a healing balm after the sterile efficiency of medical institutions.

Yet walking into our house after more than a year of absence created an unexpected sense of displacement. Everything was exactly as we had left it, but we were fundamentally different people. The physical space hadn't changed at all, but we had to relearn how to inhabit it as the transformed family we had become.

## The deterioration of neglect

One thing nobody prepares you for about extended displacement is how much a house deteriorates when left uninhabited for more than a year. Despite having family check on the property periodically, the accumulated effects of tropical humidity, dust, and simple abandonment were more extensive than anticipated. We spent weeks cleaning, repairing, and making the space habitable again—a process that felt like archaeological work, uncovering layers of who we used to be.

But perhaps more challenging was establishing new rhythms within familiar space. Unpacking possessions that belonged to our pre-crisis selves, reorganizing rooms to accommodate medical equipment we hoped never to need again, creating routines that honored both our transformed priorities and the practical demands of island life.

Neo's adaptation to Aruba was remarkably swift and natural. Watching him discover his technical birthplace—exploring the yard, experiencing tropical weather, learning to navigate spaces that were completely foreign to his Rotterdam-shaped consciousness—felt like witnessing him claim his true inheritance. Within days, he moved through our house and garden as if he had always belonged there.

For Amelie, the return represented a more complex negotiation between who she had become and who she used to be. She was overjoyed to reclaim her room, to reconnect with familiar spaces that had sustained her through childhood. But she was also eager to restore elements of our pre-departure life that had represented security and normalcy.

Fulfilling her chicken request became one of my first priorities—fixing the coop that had fallen into disrepair, selecting new birds, and reestablishing the morning routine of collecting eggs that Amelie remembered from her early childhood. Watching both children participate in this daily ritual—Amelie with the confidence of returning to familiar practices, Neo with the wonder of discovering something entirely new—felt like successfully bridging our transformed family identity with the continuity of place and tradition.

## Community recognition and performance

Our journey had been so public through social media that returning to Aruba felt like stepping back into a community that had followed our story in real-time. Nearly everyone we encountered already knew about Neo's medical struggles, our year in Rotterdam, and our recent return. This recognition was both blessing and burden—it meant we didn't have to repeatedly explain our absence, but it also meant constantly performing the role of the family that had "overcome" their crisis.

I developed a standardized response to the well-meaning inquiries that greeted us everywhere: "Yeah, baby is doing great now, thank God! But yeah, that was a horrible experience as well. But hey, like they told us, it's the parents who stay with the trauma because the baby wouldn't remember a thing. And that's the way we would want it anyway. So it's all good."

This script allowed me to acknowledge both the difficulty of our experience and our current stability while moving conversations toward more normal territory. Yet repeating these lines dozens of times created a strange sense of distance from our own story, as if I was narrating someone else's journey rather than processing my own transformation.

The most revealing encounter came during one of our first public appearances—the official opening of a social center for which Lay had developed the strategic plan through Cornerstone Economics. The event was well-attended by government officials and community leaders, creating multiple opportunities for reintegration conversations.

Several politicians approached me with genuine empathy, sharing their own experiences with medical crises or expressing authentic appreciation for the power of faith during difficult times. But one conversation revealed exactly how much I had changed during our Rotterdam journey.

A politician I knew well—her son was in Amelie's class—began with the familiar script of welcome and sympathy. But then she seamlessly transitioned into her political persona, launching into complaints about unreasonable colleagues and recent political drama. "You might have heard about some of the political issues I had to face," she continued, "and some politician who was being very unreasonable. Can you believe this and that?"

For the first time in our conversation, I felt completely disconnected from what she was saying. The political maneuvering and interpersonal conflicts that might once have engaged my interest felt utterly trivial after watching my son fight for life. I interrupted her mid-sentence: "How's your son doing?"

The question caught her completely off guard. She was so embedded in her political role that shifting to personal territory required visible mental recalibration. That interaction crystallized something important about my transformation: I could no longer tolerate conversations that treated as urgent the things that were merely important, especially when genuinely important things—like children's wellbeing—were available for discussion.

## Learning to work with powerful forces

During our final weeks in Rotterdam, as Neo reached the milestones necessary for his fit-to-fly test, I had found myself repeatedly drawn to the city's relationship with water. The Aruban sun felt different after Rotterdam. Not hotter—objectively it was the same Caribbean warmth I'd known all my life—but I experienced it differently now. During those cold Rotterdam months, I had dreamed of this heat. Now, back home with Neo thriving, I found myself thinking constantly about what the Dutch had taught me about resilience—not through lectures or policy documents, but through their relationship with water.

Rotterdam doesn't fight the sea—it works with it. Walking along the Nieuwe Maas during those final weeks before our fit-to-fly test, I had watched the massive port operations continue seamlessly despite being built on land that sits largely below sea level. The Dutch phrase "leven met water"—living with water—represented a fundamental shift in thinking that occurred after the devastating North Sea flood of 1953.

For centuries, they had built higher dikes, stronger barriers, more sophisticated pumping systems. Pure resistance. But the 1953 disaster forced a recognition that fortress-building had reached its limits. The solution became the Delta Works—an integrated system combining rigid barriers with flexible water management, allowing controlled flooding in some areas to prevent catastrophic breaches elsewhere.

Rather than hiding from water behind impenetrable walls, Rotterdam made water visible, celebrated, integral to its identity. The harbor continued to function as one of the world's busiest ports not despite the flood risk but because of innovations that worked with rather than against the water's power.

Sitting in my Savaneta office, surrounded by the paintings I'd created during our Rotterdam crisis—including that conch shell piece that held pride of place—I was discovering how this principle applied to island economies in ways I hadn't fully grasped during my years of academic research.

## Why additive logic fails

Traditional resilience thinking operates on what might be called additive logic—the assumption that protective measures stack like building blocks. More early warning systems plus better insurance plus stronger infrastructure equals more resilience. This intuition feels obvious. It is also deeply flawed.

In 1956, economists Richard Lipsey and Kelvin Lancaster proved something counterintuitive: in a world with multiple imperfections, fixing one imperfection doesn't necessarily improve outcomes—it might make them worse. When you can't achieve the ideal across all dimensions simultaneously, optimizing any single dimension may actually move you further from the best achievable outcome. Development economist Dani Rodrik has spent his career showing how this principle undermines policies that assume reforms can be stacked sequentially.

There's a related insight that's even more unsettling. British economist Charles Goodhart observed that "when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure." The moment you optimize for a specific resilience indicator, you change behavior in ways that undermine the indicator's validity. Build a resilience rating system, and organizations will game it. Measure recovery time, and you'll get faster recovery to fragile states.

I watched this pattern play out in my own region. In her 2025 Adlith Brown Lecture at the Central Bank of Curaçao and Sint Maarten, outgoing Central Bank of Aruba President Jeanette Semeleer described Aruba's journey from oil dependency to tourism dependency to—she hopes—diversified innovation. She correctly identified that "over-reliance on a single economic pillar is not a foundation but a fault line." Her phrase for what comes next echoed my own thinking: not bouncing back, but "bouncing forward to where we need to be."

Yet her proposed transformation—blue economy plus green energy plus digital infrastructure—is still additive logic. Three shells instead of one. The conch paradox suggests a more uncomfortable possibility: that Aruba's very success in pivoting from oil to tourism may have created the institutional confidence that now makes the next pivot harder. Each successful transformation teaches us that transformation works, while simultaneously building the specialized infrastructure and expertise that constrains the next transformation.

Our family's return to Aruba embodied this tension. We couldn't simply add "lessons learned" to our pre-crisis operating system and call ourselves resilient. The transformation had to be more fundamental—releasing attachment to how we used to work while maintaining commitment to what actually mattered.

## The democratization of execution

Back in Aruba, the Rotterdam principle found immediate application in my professional transformation. The experience of using AI during our crisis—when those tools enabled me to deliver that overdue consulting report while sitting in a hospital waiting room—had revealed something important about island adaptability.

The same resourcefulness that had been essential for survival in small island contexts—learning quickly, transferring skills across domains, finding opportunities within constraints—suddenly appeared not as limitation but as advanced training for thriving with new technologies.

The AI tools I'd first discovered during Neo's medical crisis were revolutionizing how small operations could compete with larger organizations. Tasks that previously required teams of specialists could now be accomplished through intelligent human-AI collaboration.

This wasn't about replacing expertise—it was about augmenting capability in exactly the ways small island economies needed most. A single consultant in Aruba could now analyze market data, synthesize policy documents, develop strategic frameworks, and create professional visualizations that would have required an entire team just a few years earlier.

For islands, this represented a fundamental shift in competitive dynamics. Our small scale—previously a constraint—could now become an advantage. We could move faster, adapt more quickly, experiment with innovative approaches that larger bureaucracies couldn't match. The same intimacy and flexibility that made island communities resilient in the face of hurricanes could be leveraged for economic innovation.

My father's story of continuous reinvention exemplifies this pattern. His willingness to learn new skills, enter unfamiliar domains, and find opportunities within constraints represents exactly the kind of flexibility that complements rather than competes with technological acceleration.

## Professional confidence, emerging blindness

This technological transformation created a sense of professional boldness I hadn't experienced before. Why limit myself to traditional economic consulting when AI assistance enabled exploration of development economics, data visualization, policy analysis, and strategic planning across multiple sectors?

The democratization of execution meant that the resourcefulness I had cultivated through island living could now be applied at unprecedented scale. Projects that would have been impossible for a small Caribbean consulting firm—comprehensive policy analysis, multi-sector strategic planning, complex data visualization—were becoming routine through intelligent collaboration with AI systems.

The Rotterdam principle was working brilliantly in my professional realm. Instead of resisting technological disruption or trying to compete with larger firms through traditional approaches, I was learning to work with AI forces while maintaining our distinctive Caribbean perspective and small-firm agility.

But even as professional success built my confidence in this adaptive approach, Lay watched my diversification with growing concern. From her perspective, I was pursuing projects that weren't necessarily well-remunerated, seeing my experimental work as distraction from the practical business of ensuring steady income for our family.

"You're not focusing on what needs to be done to put food on the table," she would argue, viewing my learning investments and innovative projects as luxuries we couldn't afford.

From my perspective, I was building long-term capabilities that would enhance our competitive position. The tension felt familiar—echoes of our pre-Rotterdam disagreements about balancing immediate practical needs with longer-term strategic investments. Crisis solidarity had temporarily united us around clear objectives, but the return to normal operations was revealing that our fundamental approaches to risk, time allocation, and priority-setting remained unresolved.

## When principles reach their limits

The Rotterdam water management philosophy worked because it honored both the power of natural forces and the legitimate needs of human communities. The Dutch didn't simply surrender to flooding—they developed sophisticated systems that accommodated controlled inundation while protecting essential functions and inhabited areas.

But I was beginning to sense that personal relationships might require different capacities entirely. Sustained emotional presence. Patience with ongoing tensions. Tolerance for the messy work of addressing incompatibilities that might never be fully resolved.

My tendency to retreat to analytical problem-solving when relationships became challenging wasn't the same as intelligent accommodation of powerful forces—it was more like reverting to the old Dutch approach of building higher walls to keep threatening waters at bay.

As I settled into my new home office in Aruba—carefully designed for productivity and comfort, with my Rotterdam paintings displayed prominently—I felt confident about the professional path forward. The Rotterdam principle had given me a framework for thriving amid technological change while maintaining my island identity.

Yet even as I arranged my books and set up my workspace, I couldn't quite shake Lay's warning from those final Rotterdam days: "What if we go back and fall into the same old patterns?"

The conch painting that watched over my daily work served as unconscious reminder of my research insights while I lived out those very patterns without recognizing them. Some powerful forces, I was starting to suspect, demanded different kinds of accommodation than others. And the most challenging applications of the Rotterdam principle might not be found in professional adaptation at all, but in the intimate daily work of sustaining a marriage through ongoing transformation.
