## Chapter 4: The Price of Protection
### "Maybe it's better to wait"

I'll never forget the phone call that crystallized everything about our position in the Netherlands. Because neither Amelie nor I could access regular medical care without being "ingeschreven" (registered) in the Netherlands, I called the gemeente in Leiden, where my sister lived, hoping to register there temporarily.

I was sitting in a Starbucks in Rotterdam, watching the city's multicultural flow through the window while I explained our complicated situation to the civil servant: we were there temporarily for our unborn son's medical care, we didn't know for how long, the apartment was provided by Aruban health insurance, and Elena couldn't deregister from Aruba without losing her health insurance coverage for Neo's upcoming surgeries.

The civil servant put me on hold for a long time. I remember stirring my coffee repeatedly, watching it cool, waiting. When she finally returned, her advice was devastating in its casual cruelty: "Your situation is complicated. Maybe it's better for you to wait. Because if your baby doesn't survive, then you don't need to have gone through all this trouble and you can just return to Aruba."

I was shocked. Not even insulted—just shocked that a Dutch civil servant could be so cold when addressing this complex set of circumstances involving a Dutch citizen's dying child. We held Dutch passports. We were Kingdom citizens. And yet, in our moment of greatest vulnerability, the system's response was to suggest we wait to see if our son died before bothering with paperwork.

This wasn't an isolated incident of individual callousness. It was, I would come to understand, the opening statement in what would become months of systematic exclusion—a pattern so consistent it couldn't be anything but policy. Representatives of the Aruban health insurance had warned us in advance about what we'd face with birth registration. They had sent patients to both the Netherlands and Colombia before, and while Arubans have Dutch nationality, it was actually easier to arrange baby registration in Colombia than in the Netherlands. At the time, I thought they were exaggerating. They weren't.

### The geography of exclusion

Finding a school for Amelie became my next lesson in how protection systems create hierarchies of belonging, even among citizens. We'd been in Rotterdam barely two weeks, just settled into the apartment overlooking the inner harbor, when I knew getting Amelie enrolled was urgent. She needed continuity. Structure. Some sense that not everything in her world had collapsed into medical uncertainty.

The first school I approached had everything—excellent online reviews, strong arts programs perfect for Amelie's creative nature, walking distance from our apartment. I remember approaching it through Rotterdam's city center, but this particular street felt almost suburban, quiet despite being so central. Art was everywhere—paintings in windows, sculptures in the courtyard, evidence of children free to be creative. The environment whispered: here, children flourish.

What I noticed immediately was how white the children were. Rotterdam is one of the most multicultural cities in Europe. You see every shade of humanity on its streets, hear dozens of languages in its markets. Yet here, in this school in the heart of the city, I saw predominantly blond Dutch children. The homogeneity was striking, intentional.

I spoke to the receptionist, and I recall being very nervous, trying my best to sound as "Dutch" as possible, as civilized as I could manage. I unconsciously straightened my posture, softened my Caribbean accent, performed belonging I didn't feel. She instructed me to write an email, which I did right there in the lobby on my phone, explaining our medical emergency, our urgent need.

The rejection came within hours: "Unfortunately, we are full and cannot accept Amelie." Polite. Final. No waiting list offered.

The same story repeated at a Montessori school with stellar reputation. Both had space for the right kind of Dutch children, apparently. Neither had space for a Dutch citizen whose crisis originated in the Caribbean.

Our final option was a Catholic school functioning as a public school, only a few hundred meters from the first school but in an entirely different world. No suburban quiet here—this was typical busy Rotterdam, so central you wondered why anyone would place a school amid such chaos. All kinds of people walked these streets, including the homeless. The building looked rough, honestly. Worn. Under-resourced.

The minute you arrived, you noticed the difference in the children. These were immigrant kids—Turkish, Moroccan, Surinamese, Eastern European. You barely saw a blond Dutch child among them. The contrast with the art school was absolute: same city, same neighborhood even, but completely different worlds.

They accepted Amelie immediately. Five minutes from our apartment. No questions about how long we'd stay, no concerns about our temporary address, no subtle evaluation of whether we belonged. Just: "She can start Monday."

Her first day, I climbed three flights of worn stairs with Elena, heavily pregnant, taking our time. Despite everything, Amelie looked ready, understanding instinctively what needed doing. She came home that first afternoon excited—another girl from Aruba was in her class, a piece of home in this strange place. Though they couldn't speak Papiamento in class, the connection mattered.

She quickly befriended two Ukrainian girls who'd recently fled the war. These children found each other naturally, sharing something profound—the sudden experience of strange countries, overnight new lives. The Ukrainian girls spoke fluent English, which Amelie spoke well, while struggling with Dutch. Amelie, accustomed to Dutch educational methods from her Aruban school, became their bridge to understanding the system. Given her helpful nature, this role suited perfectly.

The irony struck hard and stayed with me: schools with the best reputations and resources had no room for a Dutch citizen facing medical emergency, while the "rough" school welcomed her immediately, surrounding her with other children who understood displacement. Later, I'd observe that Ukrainian refugees received swift processing and housing assistance, while we—Dutch passport holders—were systematically pushed to the back of every line. The hierarchy was clear: European refugees deserved immediate protection, Caribbean Dutch citizens should wait to see if their babies survived before bothering the system.

### Morning routines and colonial echoes

Those early weeks before Neo's birth developed their own rhythm. Mornings were a rush to get Amelie ready for school. It was only a five-minute walk, but winter meant layers—undershirt, shirt, sweater, coat, scarf, gloves. Sometimes there was no time for breakfast at home. On those days, she would wear all her winter clothes in a hurry, and we would stop at the supermarket in front of our apartment block for a hot croissant. She loved them—one thing we all cherished about the Netherlands was the availability of fresh, warm croissants. She would munch while we quickly walked, crossing the busy intersection that led to her school.

After dropping her off, I'd return to our apartment with its view stretching to the maritime museum. I'd sit at the dining table with my laptop, trying to maintain my consulting work, processing our situation through spreadsheets and project plans while Elena processed through movement. She took advantage of the time before childbirth to explore Rotterdam, walking from our well-located apartment to every corner of the city center. From knowing nothing about Rotterdam, she quickly learned all the main streets—where to shop, where to take Amelie for events, where to find the best groceries.

We often explored together as a family, all on foot because we had no car and Elena doesn't enjoy riding bicycles. It was a completely different lifestyle from Aruba, where you drive everywhere. I think Elena enjoyed the walking—the freedom of it, the way it connected her to the city even as the city's systems rejected us.

Walking through Rotterdam, I became increasingly aware of the colonial history embedded in its architecture. This wasn't new knowledge—I'd attended secondary school in Den Haag when I was 15, at a school very similar to Amelie's, surrounded only by other foreigners, never really feeling comfortable with Dutch people because our interactions were so limited. But now, as an adult with my own child experiencing the same segregation, the patterns felt heavier.

The part of Rotterdam where we stayed had layers of history. Of course, there was the World War II bombing that flattened most of it, but older stories lingered. Depictions on historic buildings showed workers in tropical fields. Some buildings had ties to the East India Company. The former HBU bank building displayed its majestic globe in the lobby—artifact from when the Dutch were extracting wealth from around the world.

My favorite walk was through Kop van Zuid, where I'd once lived as a student. The converted warehouses still bore their original names in fading letters: Java, Sumatra. These were remnants from the time when Dutch prosperity was built explicitly on colonial extraction. Now, centuries later, citizens from those former colonies found themselves unwelcome in the kingdom that their islands' resources had helped build. The gemeente worker suggesting we wait to see if Neo survived was just the latest verse in a very old song.

### The informal economy of care

While formal systems failed us with remarkable consistency, informal networks emerged with surprising speed and accuracy. It started with Suyin, Elena's friend whose boyfriend was recovering from heart surgery at Erasmus. She knew the hospital, understood the Dutch medical system, could translate not just language but culture. She became our first guide, teaching us which trams to take, which doctors to trust, how to phrase requests to be heard.

Friends from years past—people we'd barely kept in touch with—suddenly appeared. The night we arrived, exhausted and overwhelmed, they picked us up and took us to an activity center where children could play. Their daughter became Amelie's lifeline, a friend who understood both Dutch systems and the experience of being different.

Two aunties and a distant aunt created an informal rotation for Amelie's care without being asked. They appeared when we had medical appointments, took her shopping for winter clothes, maintained normalcy we couldn't provide. My sister filled our fridge using delivery services when we all came down with COVID just before Neo's birth—she knew we needed help before we knew to ask for it.

They never asked what we needed—they observed and acted. When I thanked one aunt profusely for taking Amelie for an entire Saturday, she said simply: "This is what family does." No evaluation of whether we deserved help, no forms to fill out, no suggestion we wait to see if the baby survived. Just presence, immediate and unconditional.

Facebook groups for congenital diaphragmatic hernia became unexpected sources of both terror and hope. Reading about children who died was agonizing, but seeing pictures of CDH kids who grew up healthy offered concrete evidence that survival was possible. Platform CHD Netherlands provided invaluable information about navigating Dutch medical systems. The chairperson, Frank, jumped on video call to answer questions as I prepared insurance appeals, sharing knowledge no official channel would provide.

What struck me was how these informal responses intuitively understood needs that formal systems couldn't even recognize. While bureaucrats calculated whether our son would survive before offering services, strangers on the internet provided detailed advice about which NICU nurses were most flexible about parent involvement, which doctors really listened to parents, how to phrase requests to insurance companies to get approval. While the gemeente refused to register our baby without physically bringing him from the ICU to their office, online parents warned us to request specific ventilator settings, to watch for particular complications, to document everything because we'd need it later.

The contrast was absolute: formal systems designed to protect citizens created obstacles at every turn, while informal networks—family, friends, online strangers—provided immediate, practical, compassionate support. The system that should have caught us let us fall. The people who had no obligation to help caught us instead.

### The permanent ledger

Even before Neo's birth, costs accumulated that would never appear in any accounting - but not in the way outsiders might assume. Elena had practiced what she preached in her financial education courses, building reserves that would prove essential. She worked intensely right up until birth, taking advantage of remote work possibilities, closing projects and securing our financial position. We'd both prepared for this possibility without knowing it was coming.

Those reserves gave us something precious: the ability to stop working when we needed to, to focus entirely on Neo without immediate financial panic. We could afford to pause, knowing we had a buffer. A full year away from regular work, sustained by Elena's foresight and discipline.

When we returned to Aruba, it was as if we'd never left - projects immediately resumed, clients reached out, work flowed back. Our professional networks had held. But other costs were accumulating.

Amelie aged that winter in ways that had nothing to do with her birthday. She learned not to ask certain questions, to read our faces before sharing school excitement, to check on Elena constantly—bringing her water, asking if the baby was okay. Her childhood interrupted by adult worries she shouldn't have carried.

Our marriage bore weight it wasn't designed for. In Aruba, we had routines, spaces, roles that worked. In Rotterdam's small apartment, we were constantly together yet emotionally isolated by different coping mechanisms. Elena needed to talk about fears; I needed to solve problems. Elena wanted emotional presence; I provided logical analysis. She processed through walking and prayer; I processed through work and planning. The same traits that made us strong individually created friction when compressed into crisis.

One evening, as we were nearing Neo's birth and beginning to plan for our eventual return to Aruba, Elena expressed something that surprised me: "I'm happy we're going back, but I'm also afraid. I'm afraid we'll fall into the same patterns as before."

I was surprised she had mixed feelings. "Of course not," I said, but even I knew it wasn't convincing. We were both changing in ways we couldn't yet articulate, accumulating invisible damage that would only manifest later. Like interest on a loan you didn't know you'd taken, these costs would compound silently while we focused on immediate survival.

### Systematic patterns

What I initially attributed to individual incompetence or bad luck gradually revealed itself as systematic. The Knowledge Platform for Inclusive Society would later document what we experienced: 56% of the "Antillean" community in European Netherlands experiences discrimination, 36% by institutions themselves. The research validated our experience with specific findings: Caribbean Dutch nationals consistently treated worse than other citizens, municipalities operating active "discouragement policies," systematic refusal of help to Kingdom citizens from the Caribbean.

But I didn't need research to confirm what I lived. When Neo would eventually be born, Rotterdam's gemeente would tell us that since neither parent was registered in the Netherlands, they couldn't recognize a baby without registered parents. We'd be sent to Den Haag gemeente, recognized as a "border gemeente" for complex cases. There, they would insist we bring our critically ill baby from the ICU for verification, refusing to deviate from protocol even when we explained he was on life support.

Every interaction reinforced the same message: you may hold Dutch passports, but you're not really Dutch. Your crisis doesn't count the same way. Your citizenship comes with invisible asterisks.

The discrimination wasn't just individual prejudice—it was architectural, built into systems and protocols. The same Kingdom that claimed to protect its Caribbean territories created byzantine obstacles for Caribbean citizens seeking to exercise their rights. It was colonialism adapted for the 21st century: no longer explicit exclusion but systematic discouragement, bureaucratic violence replacing physical force.

### The metabolic cost of resilience

A queen conch's shell provides remarkable protection, but at enormous metabolic cost. Every bit of energy spent building and maintaining that elaborate defense is energy not available for growth, reproduction, or adaptation. The organism survives but fundamentally altered, permanently reallocated.

Small Island States face the same calculation. Every family sent abroad for medical care represents not just immediate costs but permanent losses—career interruptions that become career endings, children's education disrupted in ways that compound over generations, communities fractured by medical migration. Aruba saves money by not developing certain medical specializations locally, but the true cost includes families separated, local medical expertise never developed, acceptance that some citizens will always be medical refugees in their moments of greatest vulnerability.

We were living this trade-off in real-time. Seeking protection for Neo in the Netherlands meant accepting systematic discrimination, family separation, career damage, psychological toll. The protection came with a price that no health insurance would ever reimburse, no government support would acknowledge. We were accumulating invisible debts that would come due long after Neo's medical crisis resolved.

### The vigil

As March approached and Neo's birth became imminent, the waiting transformed into something else—a vigil. We'd done everything possible: made the FETO decision, fought for Amelie's school placement, battled bureaucracy for basic services, built informal support networks to replace formal ones that failed. Now we could only wait.

Elena walked her circuits around Rotterdam, following doctor's orders but also needing movement to manage anxiety. I watched her from our apartment window, this woman carrying our son who might not survive, walking through Dutch winter she'd never chosen, maintaining hope I wasn't sure I shared. The city that wouldn't properly register her son spread out behind her, indifferent to our crisis except as an administrative inconvenience.

The formal systems had extracted their price in dignity, time, and trust. The gemeente worker's suggestion to wait and see if Neo survived had been just the beginning. Every office visited, every form submitted, every registration refused had reinforced our outsider status. We were Kingdom citizens when it came to obligations, foreigners when it came to rights.

But the informal networks—family, friends, online communities, other displaced parents—had provided what no government office could: recognition of our humanity, immediate practical support, hope based on lived experience rather than statistics. They didn't evaluate whether we deserved help or calculate whether Neo would survive. They simply showed up.

Soon, everything would change. The birth would bring new vulnerabilities, the NICU would teach entirely different lessons about when protection helps and when it harms. Saving Neo's life would require not just medical expertise but learning to read signals formal systems couldn't recognize, building alliances with nurses and doctors who saw us as parents rather than problems.

But for now, in that strange Rotterdam winter, we existed between worlds—not quite Dutch despite our passports, not quite foreign despite our treatment, not quite patients despite our medical crisis. We were learning that seeking protection always comes with costs you can't calculate until the bills come due, that resilience isn't just about surviving but about what you're willing to sacrifice for survival.

The gemeente worker had suggested we wait to see if our baby survived before bothering with bureaucracy. We were about to find out if he would. Either way, the price of seeking protection had already been paid in currencies no insurance covered: dignity, trust, belonging, and pieces of ourselves we didn't know we could lose and still remain standing.

cost that's currently implicit: the opportunity cost of resources devoted to maintaining existing structures rather than generating new possibilities. It also sets up a more sophisticated version of the diversification discussion.

Integrate the life cycle/resource allocation question. What reproductive or generative capacity is sacrificed for shell maintenance? This works at personal level (your family's depleted reserves), island level (locked-in infrastructure), and species level (the conch itself).
