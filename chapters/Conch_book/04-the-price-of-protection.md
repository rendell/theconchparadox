## Chapter 4: The Price of Protection

I'll never forget the phone call that crystallized everything about our position in the Netherlands. Because neither Amelie nor I could access regular medical care without being "ingeschreven" (registered) in the Netherlands, I called the gemeente in Leiden, where my sister lived, hoping to register there temporarily.

I was sitting in a Starbucks in Rotterdam, watching the city's multicultural flow through the window while I explained our complicated situation to the civil servant: we were there temporarily for our unborn son's medical care, we didn't know for how long, the apartment was provided by Aruban health insurance, and Lay couldn't deregister from Aruba without losing her health insurance coverage for Neo's upcoming surgeries.

The civil servant put me on hold for a long time. I remember stirring my coffee repeatedly, watching it cool, waiting. When she finally returned, her advice was devastating in its casual cruelty: "Your situation is complicated. Maybe it's better for you to wait. Because if your baby doesn't survive, then you don't need to have gone through all this trouble and you can just return to Aruba."

I was shocked. Not even insulted—just shocked that a Dutch civil servant could be so cold when addressing this complex set of circumstances involving a Dutch citizen's dying child. We held Dutch passports. We were Kingdom citizens. And yet, in our moment of greatest vulnerability, the system's response was to suggest we wait to see if our son died before bothering with paperwork.

This wasn't an isolated incident of individual callousness. It was, I would come to understand, the opening statement in what would become months of systematic exclusion—a pattern so consistent it couldn't be anything but policy.

### The geography of exclusion

Finding a school for Amelie became my next lesson in how protection systems create hierarchies of belonging, even among citizens. We'd been in Rotterdam barely two weeks when I knew getting Amelie enrolled was urgent. She needed continuity. Structure. Some sense that not everything in her world had collapsed into medical uncertainty.

The first school I approached had everything—excellent online reviews, strong arts programs perfect for Amelie's creative nature, walking distance from our apartment. Art was everywhere—paintings in windows, sculptures in the courtyard, evidence of children free to be creative. The environment whispered: here, children flourish.

What I noticed immediately was how white the children were. Rotterdam is one of the most multicultural cities in Europe, yet here, in this school in the heart of the city, I saw predominantly blond Dutch children. The homogeneity was striking, intentional.

I spoke to the receptionist, unconsciously straightening my posture, softening my Caribbean accent, performing belonging I didn't feel. She instructed me to write an email, which I did right there in the lobby, explaining our medical emergency.

The rejection came within hours: "Unfortunately, we are full and cannot accept Amelie." Polite. Final. No waiting list offered.

The same story repeated at a Montessori school with stellar reputation. Both had space for the right kind of Dutch children, apparently. Neither had space for a Dutch citizen whose crisis originated in the Caribbean.

Our final option was a Catholic school functioning as a public school, only a few hundred meters from the first but in an entirely different world. No suburban quiet here—this was typical busy Rotterdam. The building looked rough, honestly. Worn. Under-resourced.

The minute you arrived, you noticed the difference in the children. These were immigrant kids—Turkish, Moroccan, Surinamese, Eastern European. You barely saw a blond Dutch child among them. The contrast with the art school was absolute: same city, same neighborhood, but completely different worlds.

They accepted Amelie immediately. No questions about how long we'd stay, no concerns about our temporary address, no evaluation of whether we belonged. Just: "She can start Monday."

The irony struck hard: schools with the best reputations had no room for a Dutch citizen facing medical emergency, while the "rough" school welcomed her immediately, surrounding her with other children who understood displacement.

### When systems fail the vulnerable

The weeks before Neo's birth settled into routines that revealed how protection systems work in practice. While we waited, the informal networks that had sustained us continued to expand and strengthen, filling gaps that formal institutions couldn't recognize.

### Morning routines and colonial echoes

Those weeks before Neo's birth developed their own rhythm. Mornings were a rush to get Amelie ready for school—undershirt, shirt, sweater, coat, scarf, gloves. Sometimes there was no time for breakfast at home, so she would wear all her winter clothes in a hurry, and we would stop at the supermarket for a hot croissant. She loved them—one thing we all cherished about the Netherlands was the availability of fresh, warm croissants.

After dropping her off, I'd return to our apartment with its view stretching to the maritime museum. I'd sit at the dining table with my laptop, trying to maintain my consulting work, while Lay processed through movement. She took advantage of the time before childbirth to explore Rotterdam, walking from our well-located apartment to every corner of the city center.

Walking through Rotterdam with her, I became increasingly aware of the colonial history embedded in its architecture. The part of the city where we stayed had layers of history. The converted warehouses still bore their original names in fading letters: Java, Sumatra. These were remnants from the time when Dutch prosperity was built explicitly on colonial extraction.

My favorite walk was through Kop van Zuid, where I'd once lived as a student. Depictions on historic buildings showed workers in tropical fields. The former HBU bank building displayed its majestic globe in the lobby—artifact from when the Dutch were extracting wealth from around the world.

Now, centuries later, citizens from those former colonies found themselves unwelcome in the kingdom that their islands' resources had helped build. The gemeente worker suggesting we wait to see if Neo survived was just the latest verse in a very old song.

### The informal economy of care

While formal systems failed us with remarkable consistency, informal networks emerged with surprising speed and accuracy. It started with Suyin, Lay's friend whose boyfriend was recovering from heart surgery at Erasmus. She knew the hospital, understood the Dutch medical system, could translate not just language but culture.

Friends from years past—people we'd barely kept in touch with—suddenly appeared. The night we arrived, exhausted and overwhelmed, they picked us up and took us to an activity center where children could play. Their daughter became Amelie's lifeline, a friend who understood both Dutch systems and the experience of being different.

Two aunties and a distant aunt created an informal rotation for Amelie's care without being asked. They appeared when we had medical appointments, took her shopping for winter clothes, maintained normalcy we couldn't provide. My sister filled our fridge using delivery services when we all came down with COVID just before Neo's birth—she knew we needed help before we knew to ask for it.

They never asked what we needed—they observed and acted. When I thanked one aunt profusely for taking Amelie for an entire Saturday, she said simply: "This is what family does." No evaluation of whether we deserved help, no forms to fill out, no suggestion we wait to see if the baby survived. Just presence, immediate and unconditional.

Facebook groups for congenital diaphragmatic hernia became unexpected sources of both terror and hope. Reading about children who died was agonizing, but seeing pictures of CDH kids who grew up healthy offered concrete evidence that survival was possible. Platform CHD Netherlands provided invaluable information about navigating Dutch medical systems.

What struck me was how these informal responses intuitively understood needs that formal systems couldn't even recognize. While bureaucrats calculated whether our son would survive before offering services, strangers on the internet provided detailed advice about which NICU nurses were most flexible about parent involvement, which doctors really listened to parents.

The contrast was absolute: formal systems designed to protect citizens created obstacles at every turn, while informal networks—family, friends, online strangers—provided immediate, practical, compassionate support.

### The permanent ledger

Even before Neo's birth, costs accumulated that would never appear in any accounting. Lay had practiced what she preached in her financial education courses, building reserves that would prove essential. She worked intensely right up until birth, taking advantage of remote work possibilities, closing projects and securing our financial position.

Those reserves gave us something precious: the ability to stop working when we needed to, to focus entirely on Neo without immediate financial panic. When we returned to Aruba, it was as if we'd never left—projects immediately resumed, clients reached out, work flowed back.

But other costs were accumulating.

Amelie aged that winter in ways that had nothing to do with her birthday. She learned not to ask certain questions, to read our faces before sharing school excitement, to check on Lay constantly—bringing her water, asking if the baby was okay. Her childhood interrupted by adult worries she shouldn't have carried.

Our marriage bore weight it wasn't designed for. In Aruba, we had routines, spaces, roles that worked. In Rotterdam's small apartment, we were constantly together yet emotionally isolated by different coping mechanisms. Lay needed to talk about fears; I needed to solve problems. The same traits that made us strong individually created friction when compressed into crisis.

One evening, as we neared Neo's birth, Lay expressed something that surprised me: "I'm happy we're going back, but I'm also afraid. I'm afraid we'll fall into the same patterns as before."

We were both changing in ways we couldn't yet articulate, accumulating invisible damage that would only manifest later. Like interest on a loan you didn't know you'd taken, these costs would compound silently while we focused on immediate survival.

### Systematic patterns

What I initially attributed to individual incompetence gradually revealed itself as systematic. The Knowledge Platform for Inclusive Society would later document what we experienced: 56% of the "Antillean" community in European Netherlands experiences discrimination, 36% by institutions themselves.

When Neo would eventually be born, Rotterdam's gemeente would tell us that since neither parent was registered in the Netherlands, they couldn't recognize a baby without registered parents. We'd be sent to Den Haag gemeente, recognized as a "border gemeente" for complex cases. There, they would insist we bring our critically ill baby from the ICU for verification, refusing to deviate from protocol even when we explained he was on life support.

Every interaction reinforced the same message: you may hold Dutch passports, but you're not really Dutch. Your crisis doesn't count the same way. Your citizenship comes with invisible asterisks.

The discrimination wasn't just individual prejudice—it was architectural, built into systems and protocols. The same Kingdom that claimed to protect its Caribbean territories created byzantine obstacles for Caribbean citizens seeking to exercise their rights.

### The metabolic cost of resilience

A queen conch's shell provides remarkable protection, but at enormous metabolic cost. Every bit of energy spent building and maintaining that elaborate defense is energy not available for growth, reproduction, or adaptation. The organism survives but fundamentally altered, permanently reallocated.

Small Island States face the same calculation. Every family sent abroad for medical care represents not just immediate costs but permanent losses—career interruptions that become career endings, children's education disrupted in ways that compound over generations, communities fractured by medical migration.

We were living this trade-off in real-time. Seeking protection for Neo in the Netherlands meant accepting systematic discrimination, family separation, career damage, psychological toll. The protection came with a price that no health insurance would ever reimburse, no government support would acknowledge.

### The vigil

As March approached and Neo's birth became imminent, the waiting transformed into something else—a vigil. We'd done everything possible: made the FETO decision, fought for Amelie's school placement, battled bureaucracy for basic services, built informal support networks to replace formal ones that failed.

Lay walked her circuits around Rotterdam, following doctor's orders but also needing movement to manage anxiety. I watched her from our apartment window, this woman carrying our son who might not survive, walking through Dutch winter she'd never chosen, maintaining hope I wasn't sure I shared.

The formal systems had extracted their price in dignity, time, and trust. The gemeente worker's suggestion to wait and see if Neo survived had been just the beginning. Every office visited, every form submitted, every registration refused had reinforced our outsider status.

But the informal networks—family, friends, online communities, other displaced parents—had provided what no government office could: recognition of our humanity, immediate practical support, hope based on lived experience rather than statistics.

Soon, everything would change. The birth would bring new vulnerabilities, the NICU would teach entirely different lessons about when protection helps and when it harms. But for now, in that strange Rotterdam winter, we existed between worlds—learning that seeking protection always comes with costs you can't calculate until the bills come due.
