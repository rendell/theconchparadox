# Note on Sources

This book weaves together personal narrative, professional experience, and research insights without burdening the text with academic citations. For readers who wish to explore the ideas further—or who are skeptical and want to check my claims—this note provides the scholarly foundation underlying each chapter.

The central argument emerged not from academic literature but from lived experience: watching my son fight for life while simultaneously researching how small island economies respond to crisis. Only later did I discover that the patterns I was observing had been documented across multiple disciplines. This note traces those connections.

## Chapter 1: The Conch Paradox

The queen conch's remarkable shell structure has attracted serious scientific attention. Menig et al. (2000) and Kamat et al. (2000) documented the three-tiered lamellar architecture that allows the shell to dissipate force and contain cracks so effectively. Their materials science research revealed why this structure has survived virtually unchanged for millions of years—and, implicitly, why such specialized optimization might become a liability when conditions change fundamentally.

The paradox I describe—that specialized adaptation creates new vulnerability—has parallels in evolutionary biology. Stephen Jay Gould's writings on punctuated equilibrium, particularly in _Wonderful Life_ (1989), explore how successful adaptations can become evolutionary dead ends. Richard Lewontin's work on adaptation and constraint similarly questions whether optimization for current conditions prepares organisms for future challenges.

My critique of the "resilience industrial complex" reflects a broader scholarly debate about whether resilience has become an empty buzzword. Béné et al. (2012) ask provocatively whether resilience is "New Utopia or New Tyranny?" in an IDS Working Paper that catalogues the term's elastic usage in development practice. Manyena (2006) traces how resilience migrated from engineering to ecology to social science, accumulating contradictory meanings along the way.

The foundational text for ecological resilience thinking remains C.S. Holling's 1973 paper "Resilience and Stability of Ecological Systems" in the _Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics_. Holling distinguished between engineering resilience (speed of return to equilibrium) and ecological resilience (magnitude of disturbance a system can absorb before restructuring). This distinction—largely ignored by the resilience industrial complex—is central to understanding why "bouncing back" may be precisely the wrong goal.

The single sentence in this chapter hinting at deeper economic theory ("Economists have understood for decades that you can't simply stack improvements in complex systems") refers to the theory of second best, which receives fuller treatment in Chapter 10.

## Chapter 2: When the Wave Hits

The medical details of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) draw on explanations provided by specialists at Sophia Children's Hospital in Rotterdam, supplemented by patient resources from the CDH International foundation. I have tried to translate complex medical information accurately while acknowledging that I am an economist, not a physician.

The discussion of how external shocks propagate through small island economies builds on my doctoral research at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. The theoretical framework combines Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) theory with Dynamic Capabilities Theory (DCT). Key texts include Holland's _Hidden Order_ (1995) on complex adaptive systems, and Teece, Pisano, and Shuen's foundational 1997 paper "Dynamic Capabilities and Strategic Management" in _Strategic Management Journal_.

For readers interested in how shocks transmit through SIDS economies specifically, Briguglio's 1995 paper "Small Island Developing States and Their Economic Vulnerabilities" in _World Development_ remains essential reading, as does his later work with colleagues on the "resilience framework" for small states (Briguglio et al., 2009).

## Chapter 3: The First Line of Defense

The medical decision-making framework we navigated—particularly the choice to forego experimental fetal surgery—touches on literature I encountered only after the fact. Gerd Gigerenzer's work on heuristics and decision-making under uncertainty, especially _Risk Savvy_ (2014), helped me understand why our instinct to "trust natural resilience" wasn't irrational, even when it contradicted the bias toward intervention that pervades modern medicine.

Atul Gawande's _Being Mortal_ (2014) shaped my thinking about when medical intervention serves patients versus when it serves the medical system's preference for action. His observation that "courage is the strength to recognize both" resonated deeply with our experience.

## Chapter 4: The Price of Protection

The hidden costs of protective mechanisms—a theme throughout this book—connects to economic literature on moral hazard and unintended consequences. The classic treatment is Peltzman's 1975 paper on automobile safety regulation, which documented how safety improvements led drivers to take greater risks, partially offsetting the intended benefits.

For SIDS contexts, the tension between protection and constraint appears in debates about tourism dependency. Scheyvens and Momsen's 2008 paper on tourism and poverty reduction in small island states explores how successful tourism development can simultaneously create prosperity and vulnerability.

---

## Chapter 5: Sensing Change

The distinction between formal and informal monitoring systems draws on James Scott's _Seeing Like a State_ (1998), which documents how high-modernist schemes to improve the human condition have repeatedly failed by ignoring local knowledge. Scott's concept of "mētis"—practical knowledge that cannot be captured in formal systems—proved surprisingly applicable to understanding how our family navigated medical bureaucracy.

For early warning systems in disaster contexts, the literature is extensive. Basher's 2006 paper "Global Early Warning Systems for Natural Hazards" provides technical background, while Kelman and Glantz (2014) offer critical perspectives on why early warnings often fail to translate into early action.

---

## Chapter 6: The Adaptation Dilemma

The challenge of maintaining identity while adapting to radically new circumstances connects to psychological literature on post-traumatic growth. Tedeschi and Calhoun's work, particularly their 2004 paper "Posttraumatic Growth: Conceptual Foundations and Empirical Evidence," provides frameworks for understanding how crisis can catalyze positive transformation rather than merely causing damage.

For the economic parallel—how SIDS balance tradition with necessary change—Baldacchino's extensive work on island economies is invaluable. His edited volume _A World of Islands_ (2007) and numerous papers explore the particular constraints and opportunities facing small island territories.

---

## Chapter 7: Network Effects

The superiority of informal networks over formal systems during crisis draws on extensive disaster research. Aldrich's _Building Resilience_ (2012) documents how social capital consistently outperforms physical infrastructure in determining post-disaster outcomes. His finding that communities with stronger informal networks recover faster—regardless of physical damage levels—aligned precisely with our experience at Ronald McDonald House.

Granovetter's classic 1973 paper "The Strength of Weak Ties" provides theoretical grounding for understanding how network structure shapes information flow and resource access during crisis.

---

## Chapter 8: Regeneration and Recovery

The distinction between recovery and transformation builds on Folke et al.'s 2010 paper "Resilience Thinking: Integrating Resilience, Adaptability and Transformability" in _Ecology and Society_. Their framework distinguishes between adaptability (capacity to adjust within the current system) and transformability (capacity to create fundamentally new systems when existing ones become untenable).

Walker and Salt's accessible book _Resilience Thinking_ (2006) translates these ecological concepts for general readers and influenced how I think about the relationship between persistence and change.

## Chapter 9: The Organizational Shell

The World Bank's institutional dynamics that I observed as a consultant reflect patterns documented in organizational theory. DiMaggio and Powell's 1983 paper on "institutional isomorphism" explains why organizations in the same field tend to become increasingly similar over time—a form of organizational shell-building that can reduce adaptive capacity.

For the specific context of development institutions, Easterly's _The White Man's Burden_ (2006) and _The Tyranny of Experts_ (2013) offer critical perspectives on how development organizations can become trapped by their own frameworks. Mosse's _Cultivating Development_ (2005) provides ethnographic insight into how development projects actually function versus how they are formally described.

## Chapter 10: Beyond Recovery

The theoretical heart of this chapter—the additive fallacy—draws on the economic theory of second best. The foundational paper is Lipsey and Lancaster's "The General Theory of Second Best" in the _Review of Economic Studies_ (1956). Their proof that optimizing one variable in a system with multiple constraints doesn't necessarily improve overall outcomes remains one of the most important—and most ignored—results in welfare economics.

Dani Rodrik has done more than any contemporary economist to apply second-best thinking to development policy. His paper "Second-Best Institutions" (2008) in the _American Economic Review_ is essential reading, as is his book _One Economics, Many Recipes_ (2007). For readers wanting his most recent thinking, _Straight Talk on Trade_ (2017) extends these arguments to contemporary debates about globalization.

Goodhart's Law—"when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure"—originated in Charles Goodhart's 1975 work on monetary policy but was generalized by anthropologist Marilyn Strathern in her 1997 paper "'Improving Ratings': Audit in the British University System." The four variants of Goodhart's Law are usefully catalogued in Manheim and Garrabrant's paper "Categorizing Variants of Goodhart's Law" (2018).

The World Bank's "Rethinking Resilience: Adapting to a Changing Climate" (Shilpi, Kahn, and Berg, 2025) represents the institutional approach I critique in this chapter. The report is freely available through the World Bank's Open Knowledge Repository and deserves engagement on its own terms—it contains valuable evidence even where I disagree with its framework. Hallegatte et al.'s earlier _Unbreakable_ (2017) provides additional context for the Bank's evolving thinking on resilience.

Jeanette Semeleer's Adlet Brown Memorial Lecture, delivered at the 56th Annual Monetary Studies Conference in November 2025, is referenced directly. Her phrase "bouncing forward" aligned remarkably with my own framework, though our conclusions about solutions diverge.

## The Rotterdam Principle

Rotterdam's approach to water management—living with water rather than fighting it—informs the book's argument about working with forces rather than rigidly resisting them. Meyer's _Delta Urbanism_ (2017) provides accessible introduction to Dutch water management philosophy. The Room for the River program, which deliberately creates space for flooding rather than simply building higher dikes, exemplifies the adaptive approach I contrast with conventional resilience thinking.

## On SIDS and the Caribbean

Readers interested in Small Island Developing States will find the UN's SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway (2014) provides policy context, while academic treatment appears in _The Handbook of Small States_ (Baldacchino, 2018) and the journal _Island Studies Journal_, which publishes cutting-edge research on island territories.

For the Dutch Caribbean specifically, Veenendaal's work on small state politics and Oostindie and Klinkers' _Decolonising the Caribbean_ (2003) provide historical and political context that informs my analysis even where not directly cited.
