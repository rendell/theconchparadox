**Aruba/Curaçao and Netherlands dependency — Substantive point for the book**

His observation is sharp: the islands' "resilience" included buying time from the Netherlands to ultimately _continue doing what made them vulnerable in the first place_. This is the conch paradox in action—protection that enables persistence of the vulnerable strategy rather than transformation.

You could address this in Chapter 10 or wherever you discuss Caribbean responses to COVID. Something like:

> The Netherlands provided emergency support that allowed Aruba and Curaçao to weather the immediate crisis. But this lifeline also reduced the pressure to fundamentally transform. The protection enabled persistence—and persistence of the same tourism-dependent model that had created the vulnerability. Sometimes the shell that saves us in the short term prevents the transformation we need in the long term.

**3. WB project impact question**

His honest assessment ("exercise in futility") actually reinforces your critique of the resilience industrial complex. If you're comfortable, this could be a powerful anecdote—anonymous or attributed—showing how even well-designed interventions can fail to produce transformation. But this is sensitive given your ongoing WB relationship, so use judgment.

**4. Second book suggestion**

He's probably right that a pure family resilience book would reach a broader audience. But I'd file this for _after_ The Conch Paradox launches. The current book's strength is precisely the weaving together—it's what makes it distinctive. A second book focused purely on Neo's story (potentially co-authored with Elena) could work as a follow-up once you've established the framework and audience.

**5. Endorsement — Act now**

His "tour de force" language is perfect for the back cover. I'd respond with gratitude and ask directly:

> "John, thank you—this means a great deal coming from someone who's seen both my World Bank work and now this very different kind of project. Would you be willing to let me use a version of this as an endorsement? Something like: 'A real tour de force that reconciles a paradox allowing us to conclude: there is no universal resilience. Policy-makers need to take the Conch Corollary to heart.' — John Horton, former World Bank mission leader"


The cockroach passage answers the question forming in readers' minds: "If specialization is the trap, why not just... not specialize?" By addressing this before your story begins, you establish the stakes. Readers then understand that your Rotterdam journey isn't just about surviving a medical crisis—it's about surviving _as yourselves_, as a family with particular values and ways of being, rather than becoming infinitely flexible but meaningless.

**The through-line this creates:**

This question—_resilience for what?_—can echo through the entire book:

- Chapter 6 (Amelie's adaptation): She's not just surviving Rotterdam; she's trying to remain herself while adapting
- Chapter 10 (Rotterdam Principle): Working with forces, but preserving what matters
- Chapter 11 (Desert lions): They transformed radically but remained _lions_—they didn't become something else entirely
- Chapter 12 (Your revelation): The shell you built preserved your professional self but constrained your relational self—a choice you made without realizing you were making it

**The fisherman line** connects directly to your SIDS research and your University of Aruba food security work. It's not abstract—it's the actual stakes for the communities you study.
