I just finished reading the text, and I think it is brilliant! First of all, of course I had no idea of the terrible experience you had with the health of your son, and I hope he fully recovered after what happened in Rotterdam (you don’t say anything explicitly about this, so maybe you want to reassure readers that he is doing OK now, if that is the case..). Second, I really like how you interweave this deeply personal experience with new academic insights about resilience and vulnerability; that combination works very well, especially for a popular science book.

I have two points of feedback:

- I think you should perhaps make clearer in the beginning what resilience measures were taken in both cases (your son and SIDS), and why in both cases they created new vulnerabilities. This does become clear at the end, but you leave it a little bit to the reader to fill in these blanks. I would maybe add a single paragraph to the text where you make the comparison / analogy directly explicit by mentioning these four points (1: resilience measures taken for your son, 2: why they created new vulnerabilities, 3: resilience measures taken for SIDS, 4: why they create new vulnerabilities). This would help the reader to understand the analogy better, because it of course appears to be quite far-fetched when you first read it, while you then convincingly show that this is not the case.
- Second, a question I have after reading this is: what would the alternative look like, i.e. what if you would not take any resilience measures and just decide to let go – both for your son and SIDS? I assume this will be explained later in the book, but if this is a preview of the entire book then you maybe want to provide some answers to this already. What will be the main takeaway / advice from the book, if it is not resilience measures? Is it simply accepting vulnerability? You mention for your son that letting go worked out well (I think?), but what is the lesson for SIDS? This is what most readers will be interested in. If SIDS should not take resilience measures, but should just accept vulnerability, what would that mean in practice, and how/why would that improve the situation?

Congratulations on getting this far in the process of writing your book. I am excited to follow the launch and to further read. I’m happy to hear that Neo is doing well and once he is able to read, he can read how his parents felt before his birth. That is a very precious gift. Below I summed up some thoughts, followed by some small remarks:

·       Catchy title, the sentence "Our greatest strengths often contain the seeds of our greatest vulnerabilities. The shell that protects also constrains." Made me further think about it, and it makes so much sense.

·       It’s nice to see that you have exclusive content for people who now subscribe to the newsletter. This makes me curious!

·       I love the idea of weaving together the three topics you described. Again, you are making me curious. Including your personal story also adds a personal touch to the book.

·       Your writing style is very enjoyable. At times intimate, at times humourful. But always convincing.

Feedback:

·       I had trouble finding the button to subscribe to the newsletter, perhaps it’s better visible above the book instead of below it.

·       Home: not by building stronger shells, but by developing the wisdom to know when protection becomes **a** constraint

·       In the about section on the webpage you also name the natural history of the queen conch as one of the three themes that the book weaves together, but you don’t mention that in the preface.

·       Chapter 1: “Even in disaster response, the pattern held. The formal emergency systems designed to protect island communities often proved less effective than informal networks when novel threats emerged that didn't fit existing protocols. The official structures, perfected for hurricane response, couldn't pivot quickly to pandemic requirements.”: I got a bit lost here, perhaps a bit more contextualization could help me better understand it, is this related to wearing mouthmasks and adhering to other rules during the COVID-19 crisis?

Chapter 1: “Let me make the parallel direct, because it's not obvious at first glance how a family medical crisis and island economic policy could possibly **be** the same pattern.” : should “be” be replaced with have or hold?

 Your book is a real tour de force:
 1 taking on the tough and very personal experience of choices that have Neo to overcome the odds; and
2 drawing upon the parallels to understanding economic resilience in a new way, what would seem to be a paradoxical way.

Reconciling that paradox allows us to conclude: there is no universal resilience.  Policy-makers need to take that principle (the Conch Corellary) to heart. 

I’m Imagining that you will be addressing the  case of Aruba’s & Curaçao economic resilience over decades, brought to their knees by COVID/ trade closure.  I’m not sure if it’s cynical or just the way of the world to say that Aruba’s & Curaçao’s resilience included buying time from the Government of the Netherlands, to tread water, ultimately to continue doing what they’ve done since they became reliant on tourism.

This is a bit of an aside just for my curiosity, not necessarily for the book - but who knows - Rendell, did either of the projects / the guidance we developed under the WB contract have any impact whatsoever?  People ask me and, without any word in the affirmative, I tell them I suspect not. A very interesting and energizing exercise in futility!  I would never have met you nor had the opportunity to learn so much.

Last word: Your book is the culmination of your dissertation journey- much under very trying circumstances.  It makes perfect sense for your profession.  But I would add that it behooves you to consider a 2nd version of this tour de force.   Presumably to be co-authored with your wife, you should consider a separate book just focused on personal and family resilience as you approached and overcame your ordeal.  The irony may be that while you continue and flourish in your “day job” as an economist, the much broader audience may well be for the 2nd book!  I’m serious.  I’m not sure if that effort, focused on Neo’s story but inextricably your family story, would demand too much emotionally, but I suspect it could help many families and quite possibly generate healthy royalties for years to come. You could even envision sequels as Neo’s journey continues through childhood, adolescence and early adulthood.

algun metaphors ta sinti un tiki porta heavy handed of kort om de bocht pero then again that's the point of a metaphor. 

pero e concept ta zone interesting and timely. there is a need to rethink how we are doing things. anto the same systems that got us in trouble are likely
not what will get us out of trouble

This is a fascinating topic and a wonderful thesis, especially this “My research revealed a troubling pattern: the very adaptations that create resilience against familiar threats often leave systems most vulnerable to novel ones”
Note the non-paradox of the cockroach… able to adapt in all climates and survive nearly any threat, it is as ubiquitous as it is disgusting.  Must we become like the roach to survive? Or is it better to fade away and leave our magnificent conch shells as our legacy.

Working on it

ma lese!! Bo story telling ability ta hopi bon. Dus e tekst ta skibi na un manera hopi appealing. Ma enjoy lese. Mi ta compronde unda bo kier bai, pero den mi opinion e ta un thema hopi broad. Dus je kan echt alle kanten op. Dus even mi no a follow e story line pero despues ma compronde kiko bo kier a bisa. Dor cu ba usa un broad subject as resilience paradox illustra den diferente aspecto. Dus e sequence con bo ta bai trese den bo buki pa mi personal opinion mester ta duidelijk aangeven pa e reader no perde e essentie di loke bo kier trese dilanti
Bo a usa personal life and economic bow di un umbrella, dus esey ta tricky as your subject is very broad.
Pero si bo a write e book mane e short version cu ma lesa, e ta un buki cu lo keep me going
mi ta full proud cu bo ta hasiendo e! Pero e un thema cu pami ta touch mi of lo touch hopi hende, paso nos tur ta come to realize cu loke na crese pensando cu ba plan bo bida certain way cu ba pensa ta "verstandig" y toch e rules nan no a apply
dus very good subject

 I really loved it! It just makes sense, the narrative is great and even though it’s not the aim, still analytical (: especially being here (Rotterdam) while reading it, and also being a person who used resilience frameworks in her own research, I enjoyed how you deconstructed the concept, and with your examples…

# Antonio Baez (dean univerity of Sint Maarten)
Enhorabuena Rendell!  This book will have an impact worldwide and contribute to Caribbean philosophy of science. I am very impressed and wish you well in the finalisation.

# Indra Zaandam (policy officer, government of Aruba)
What can I say…It’s really good. I even got a bit emotional for various reasons. 
Indeed what for a long time can serve as your protection , can be the one thing that inhibits you. 
Thank you for sharing your story and for combining the personal with the scientific.

Looking forward to the rest.✅

Ik heb de preface en eerste deel gelezen. Intrigerend! Ben benieuwd naar de rest van je boek 🤗
Ik heb me aangemeld voor updates.

Uit meerdere trainingen die ik gevolgd heb,  ook gericht persoonlijk leiderschap is een van de uitgangspunten dat je sterkste eigenschappen  ook je grootste valkuilen kunnen zijn.  Dat ligt wel een beetje in lijn met jouw verhaal.  
Het is wel ook heel intrigerend vind ik zelf ook te kijken naar waar in huidig opzicht de zwakten zitten, juist ook iets heel sterks verborgen kan zijn.  Omdenken is een groot goed.  
Ik lees er graag over want het helpt om vanuit andere perspectieven te benaderen. 
Thanks! Ik kijk uit naar je publicatie.
