### When your research becomes your life

The WhatsApp notification arrived on a Tuesday morning while I was reviewing economic data for a Caribbean disaster assessment. The message was from a colleague in the World Bank's short-term consultant network—a group of us scattered across continents, connected by our precarious relationship with the institution that employed us in fragments of time.

_"Honestly, why didn't they just restrict the number and duration of contracts and call it 'reform'? This is so chaotic."_

More messages poured in over the following hours. Anxiety mixed with analysis, confusion laced with gallows humor. The World Bank had announced sweeping reforms to its contingent workforce model. Those of us who had spent years as Short-Term Consultants—some working 150 days annually for the same teams—were being told our employment category would be eliminated.

_"My own way of making sense of it all is that the current management is doing anything it can to appease the US government, not realising this is just like carrying water using a leaky bucket."_

I sat in my home office in Aruba, surrounded by the conch paintings I'd created during our Rotterdam crisis, reading through the reform documents. The irony was almost too perfect to bear. For years, I had been analyzing how Caribbean island nations respond to vulnerability—how they build specialized economic structures that become rigid constraints when circumstances change. Now I was experiencing the same pattern at a different scale, in an institution I had trusted to fund my research on exactly this phenomenon.

The World Bank was facing its own conch paradox.

### The shell I depended on

I thought about my colleagues in the WhatsApp chat. Many had dedicated years to World Bank work, building specialized expertise in disaster assessment, climate finance, food security analysis. We had become the institutional equivalent of what I studied in Caribbean economies—specialized resources optimized for efficiency, suddenly vulnerable when the system changed.

The model had worked brilliantly for decades. Short-Term Consultants like me provided flexibility and specialized expertise without the overhead of permanent staff. Need a disaster risk financing specialist for a three-month assessment in the Caribbean? Hire an STC. The institution could respond to crises with agility that permanent staffing structures couldn't match.

But the 2024 US presidential election changed everything. The Trump administration's return brought explicit hostility toward multilateral institutions. The contingent workforce that had provided flexibility was now viewed as a political liability. The very efficiency that STCs represented—specialized expertise without permanent commitment—became something to be eliminated rather than valued.

The mathematics were simple: the bank was eliminating flexibility in response to uncertainty. Fewer consultants, less adaptability, more rigidity. The institution was strengthening its shell precisely when it needed to question whether that shell still served its purpose.

### Living the research

"The other thing is to do a PhD on how the development and humanitarian system will need to reform in a context of failing multilateralism," one colleague wrote. "I think people who solve this question will be the leaders of the new system, whatever shape it takes."

I stared at the message. I was literally doing a PhD on adaptation and transformation in the face of systemic vulnerability. And now the institution funding that research was demonstrating the exact failure mode I was studying—responding to threat by strengthening existing structures rather than building adaptive capacity.

The personal stakes made the pattern more visible, not less. When your economic security depends on an institution's decisions, you pay closer attention to the logic driving them.

What I saw was an organization that had built such an effective protective shell that it could no longer sense when that shell had become a constraint. The bank's own Chief Economist had stated plainly at a conference that year: "There is no independent thinking in this institution." Yet the institutional response was to eliminate the one department specifically charged with independent thinking—merging research into operational units where analysis would serve transactions rather than truth.

This was the organizational equivalent of what I had observed in island economies: optimization within an existing model rather than questioning whether the model itself remained viable. Tourism-dependent islands kept rebuilding the same infrastructure after each hurricane. The World Bank kept reinforcing the same structures even as the world they were designed for disappeared.

### The question that haunts

My colleague's message kept returning to me: "So who is going to step in to fill the void?"

If the post-World War II multilateral system is failing, if institutions like the World Bank are too rigid to transform, if nation states are retreating from global cooperation even as global challenges intensify—what comes next?

The small island states I study can't afford to wait for multilateral institutions to reform. They're already building alternative networks, regional cooperation mechanisms, local resilience capacity. Not because it's optimal—it's not—but because it's necessary. When the systems designed to protect you become constraints, you find other ways to survive.

Perhaps that's what transformation actually looks like. Not reformed institutions with better leadership, but entirely new configurations that emerge when old shells can no longer protect what matters.

The World Bank's struggle illuminates something I was also learning in my marriage, my family, my own patterns of retreat and protection: systems optimized for one era eventually confront conditions they weren't built to handle. The response—strengthening existing structures, eliminating flexibility, doubling down on what used to work—is comprehensible. It may even feel inevitable.

But it's not transformation. It's the institutional equivalent of the conch building a stronger shell as the ocean warms around it.

I looked up from my laptop at the conch painting hanging across from my desk. The shell I'd rendered so carefully during those Rotterdam months—was I studying institutions, or was I studying myself?

The question wouldn't leave me alone. It followed me from the WhatsApp thread full of anxious colleagues into my research on island economies, into my observations of my own protective patterns, into the growing recognition that the shells we build—personal, institutional, national—all eventually face the same reckoning.

The only question is whether we recognize the constraint before the shell becomes our tomb.
