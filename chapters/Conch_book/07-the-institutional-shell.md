## Chapter 7: The Institutional Shell

### When Organizations Can't Adapt

The WhatsApp notification arrived on a Tuesday morning while I was reviewing economic data for a Caribbean disaster assessment. The message was from a colleague in the World Bank's short-term consultant network—a group of us scattered across continents, connected by our precarious relationship with the institution that employed us in fragments of time.

_"Honestly, why didn't they just restrict the number and duration of contracts and call it 'reform'? This is so chaotic."_

More messages poured in over the following hours. Anxiety mixed with analysis, confusion laced with gallows humor. The World Bank had announced sweeping reforms to its contingent workforce model. Those of us who had spent years as Short-Term Consultants—some working 150 days annually for the same teams—were being told our employment category would be eliminated.

_"My own way of making sense of it all is that the current management is doing anything it can to appease the US government, not realising this is just like carrying water using a leaky bucket."_

_"I wish the Bank leadership would relocate the HQ from the US! Surely a country out there could accommodate all of us."_

As I read through the thread, I felt the familiar cognitive dissonance that comes from living inside a system while simultaneously studying its dysfunction. For years, I had been analyzing how Caribbean island nations respond to vulnerability—how they build specialized economic structures that become rigid constraints when circumstances change. Now I was experiencing the same pattern at a different scale, in an institution I had trusted to fund my research on exactly this phenomenon.

The World Bank was facing its own conch paradox. The specialized adaptations that had made it efficient and effective were now the exact vulnerabilities being exploited. And like the islands I studied, like my own family navigating impossible medical decisions, the institution's response was to strengthen its existing shell rather than question whether that shell was still viable.

## The Perfect Shell

The World Bank Group built its influence over decades through a particular organizational model, each element carefully optimized for its context. The institution maintained its global headquarters in Washington, DC, anchoring it to the world's largest economy and most powerful democracy. This US-centricity wasn't accidental—it provided legitimacy, funding stability, and political protection that made the bank's work possible.

The contingent workforce model was another adaptation. Short-Term Consultants provided flexibility and specialized expertise without the overhead of permanent staff. Need a disaster risk financing specialist for a three-month assessment in the Caribbean? Hire an STC. Need agricultural economists for a food security project in the Pacific? STCs could be mobilized quickly, deployed efficiently, and released when the work was done. The model allowed the bank to respond to crises and opportunities with agility that permanent staffing structures couldn't match.

Research independence was the third pillar. The Development Economics Research Group (DECRG) operated with unusual autonomy within the institution, able to publish findings that questioned bank policies, challenged operational assumptions, and explored development questions before they became institutional priorities. When DECRG researchers found high levels of teacher absenteeism in India, revealing uncomfortable truths about education systems the bank was financing, their independence allowed publication despite pressure to suppress the findings. When they questioned the effectiveness of community-driven development programs, their autonomy enabled critique that eventually transformed bank operations.

These three elements—US headquarters, contingent workforce flexibility, and research independence—formed an organizational shell that protected the institution while allowing it to function effectively in a complex global environment. Like the conch's three-layered protection system, each element served a specific defensive purpose. Together, they made the World Bank remarkably successful at its mission.

Until they didn't.

### When Protection Becomes Constraint

The 2024 US presidential election changed the context in which the World Bank operated. The Trump administration's return brought an explicit hostility toward multilateral institutions and a transactional approach to international development that threatened the bank's fundamental assumptions. The US-centric model that had provided stability and legitimacy for decades suddenly became a profound vulnerability.

The contingent workforce that had provided flexibility was now viewed as a legal and political liability. Questions arose about employment classification, visa status for consultants based in the US, and the bank's obligations to its temporary workers. The very efficiency that STCs represented—specialized expertise without permanent commitment—became something to be eliminated rather than valued.

Most troubling was what happened to research independence. In October 2024, development economists Eeshani Kandpal and Charles Kenny published a blog post titled "The World Bank Group Reorganization: A Retreat from Research Quality?" Their analysis was damning. The proposed reforms would integrate the independent research department (DECRG) into operational units, placing research under the same management structure responsible for lending and deal-making.

As Kandpal and Kenny wrote: "In the new model, it appears that the short-term concerns of the World Bank Group's dealmakers are likely to gain greater influence over analytical and research output, a step back from a 'knowledge bank' and towards the model of economist as salesperson all too common at investment banks."

The institution's own Chief Economist had identified the problem earlier that year. At the 2025 Annual Bank Conference on Development Economics, Indermit Gill stated plainly: "There is no independent thinking in this institution." His assessment suggested that groupthink was already constraining the bank's effectiveness.

Yet the institutional response to this recognized lack of adaptability was to eliminate the one department specifically charged with independent thinking.

### Strengthening the Shell

The World Bank's reform strategy revealed a pattern I had seen repeatedly in my research: when institutions face uncertainty, they typically respond by strengthening their existing structures rather than questioning whether those structures remain appropriate.

The research reorganization would place analysis under operational management, merging deal-making with policy research. This increased the risk that analysis would serve transactions rather than truth. As Kandpal and Kenny noted, previous attempts at such mergers had been unwound precisely because of conflicts of interest. Yet the new reorganization was unprecedented in extent.

The contingent workforce reform followed similar logic. Rather than creating flexible employment models for a changing world, the institution chose elimination. The mathematics were clear: fewer consultants, less flexibility, more rigidity.

The US-centricity remained unquestioned. While other multilateral institutions like UNICEF were actively planning to relocate headquarters in response to geopolitical shifts, World Bank management seemed determined to appease rather than adapt.

Each reform strengthened existing structures while eliminating flexibility, diversity, and independence. The shell was being reinforced even as the environment that shell was designed for disappeared.

### The Personal Stakes

I sat in my home office in Aruba, reading through the reform documents. The mathematics were simple: the bank was eliminating flexibility in response to uncertainty. The contingent workforce that had provided specialized expertise would be cut. Some would transition to more expensive, less supported arrangements. Many would simply be released.

I thought about my colleagues in the WhatsApp chat. Many had dedicated years to World Bank work, building specialized expertise in disaster assessment, climate finance, food security analysis. We had become the institutional equivalent of what I studied in Caribbean economies—specialized resources optimized for efficiency, suddenly vulnerable when the system changed.

"The other thing is to do a PhD on how the development and humanitarian system will need to reform in a context of failing multi lateralism," one colleague had written. "I think people who solve this question will be the leaders of the new system, whatever shape it takes."

The irony wasn't lost on me. I was literally doing a PhD on adaptation and transformation in the face of systemic vulnerability. And now the institution funding that research was demonstrating the exact failure mode I was studying—responding to vulnerability by strengthening rigidities rather than building adaptive capacity.

The personal stakes made the pattern more visible, not less. When your own economic security depends on an institution's decisions, you pay closer attention to the logic driving them.

### The Pattern Repeats

The organizational conch paradox wasn't unique to the World Bank. It's a pattern that emerges whenever institutions face environments that change faster than their ability to transform.

Consider how this mirrors the challenges facing Caribbean nations I studied. Tourism-dependent economies had spent decades perfecting their specialized economic models. Each hurricane, they rebuilt stronger, more refined, more efficient. The specialization created remarkable growth during stable periods. But when COVID-19 stopped global travel entirely, that same specialization became a trap. There was no flexibility, no alternative revenue sources, no adaptive capacity built into the system.

The World Bank's model worked brilliantly for a post-Cold War world of US hegemony and faith in multilateral cooperation. Contingent workers provided expertise without permanent commitment. Research independence generated credibility that justified lending. US headquarters anchored the institution to reliable funding and political support.

But in a world of nationalist populism, declining trust in multilateral institutions, and explicit US hostility toward international cooperation, those same adaptations became liabilities. The contingent workforce was politically vulnerable. Research independence was sacrificed for operational alignment. US-centricity meant the institution was hostage to American political volatility.

Like the conch perfecting its shell over millennia only to find that shell useless against warming oceans and industrial fishing, the World Bank had optimized for a world that was disappearing.

### What Independence Enables

The CGDev blog post by Kandpal and Kenny made a crucial point about why institutional independence matters: without it, organizations lose the capacity to learn from their own failures.

They pointed to a telling example. When DECRG research questioned the bank's approach to community-driven development, it met "significant resistance from senior management." But that independent critique eventually transformed bank operations. The institution effectively stopped its old model and replaced it with approaches that addressed the research concerns.

More recently, DECRG research on poverty trends in India contradicted official government numbers that bank management was inclined to accept. The research suggested slower poverty reduction than officials claimed. Without independence, there would have been "little analysis of the rose-tinted narrative."

This was the function being eliminated—the capacity to question operational assumptions, to challenge narratives that served short-term lending goals, to test bank policies empirically rather than simply justify them.

At the 2025 Annual Bank Conference on Development Economics, the bank's own Chief Economist identified the problem. Indermit Gill stated plainly: "There is no independent thinking in this institution."

Yet the institutional response to this recognized lack of adaptability was to eliminate the department specifically charged with independent thinking.

This was the organizational equivalent of what I had observed in island economies: optimization within an existing model rather than questioning whether the model itself remained viable.

### The Failing Multilateralism Context

The World Bank's struggles reflected a broader crisis in the multilateral system. The post-World War II architecture of international cooperation—the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, World Trade Organization—had been built on assumptions about global governance that were unraveling.

Those institutions assumed that nation states would continue collaborating on global challenges. They assumed the United States would maintain interest in international development and multilateral problem-solving. They assumed that technical expertise and evidence-based analysis would carry weight in policy decisions.

All of those assumptions were failing simultaneously.

In the WhatsApp chat, one colleague had observed: "I don't think there's anything that discusses this directly—as the end of multi lateralism only became clear with Trump 2.0. People have been looking to reform the system for a long time under the agenda of humanitarian and development localization. But it's always been assumed that nation states will continue supporting the system. Now the very idea of nation states collaborating on global issues is being eroded, but the challenges remain. So who is going to step in to fill the void?"

This was the question. Climate change, pandemic response, financial stability, forced migration—the challenges that multilateral institutions were designed to address hadn't disappeared. If anything, they were intensifying. But the institutional architecture for addressing them was built for a world that no longer existed.

The World Bank's response—strengthening US-centricity, eliminating workforce flexibility, sacrificing research independence—looked increasingly like an organization doubling down on a failing model. Other institutions were at least exploring alternatives. UNICEF was considering relocating its headquarters. Regional development banks were building capacity independent of US funding and political influence.

But the World Bank seemed paralyzed by its own success. The shell that had protected it for so long was now the constraint preventing transformation.

### Transformation vs. Strengthening

The distinction between strengthening existing structures and genuine transformation had become central to my research on small island adaptation. Islands that succeeded weren't the ones that rebuilt exactly the same tourism infrastructure after hurricanes. They were the ones that used disruption as an opportunity to diversify, to relocate vulnerable assets, to create new economic functions alongside tourism rather than instead of it.

Transformation doesn't mean abandoning what works. It means accepting that systems optimized for one set of conditions may need fundamental reconfiguration when those conditions change dramatically.

For the World Bank, transformation might have meant genuinely decentralizing power, not just people. Protecting research independence rather than eliminating it. Creating diverse employment models rather than forcing rigidity. Building capacity to question institutional assumptions alongside capacity to execute current strategies.

But transformation requires acknowledging that your current model might be fundamentally unsuited to emerging conditions. It requires accepting that the shell that protected you may now constrain you. It requires the courage to question assumptions that have defined institutional identity for decades.

This is why transformation is so difficult. It's not just about changing structures or processes. It's about changing the fundamental logic that made those structures successful in the first place.

### Living Inside the Shell

There's a particular cognitive dissonance that comes from studying systemic failure while being part of the system that's failing. I had spent years analyzing how Caribbean nations struggle to move beyond repetitive cycles of disaster and reconstruction, how they optimize within constrained models rather than questioning the constraints themselves.

Now I was living that analysis from inside a failing institution.

The World Bank was responding to uncertainty by strengthening its existing shell—eliminating workforce flexibility, sacrificing research independence, doubling down on US-centricity—rather than questioning whether that shell remained appropriate for the world it now occupied.

The personal stakes made the pattern more visible, not less. When your economic security depends on an institution's decisions, you pay closer attention to the logic driving them.

What I saw was an organization that had built such an effective protective shell that it could no longer sense when that shell had become a constraint. The very success of the model made it difficult to question. The efficiencies were real. The credibility was genuine. The global influence was undeniable.

But all of it rested on assumptions about the world that were dissolving. And rather than adapt to the world that was emerging, the institution was trying to make the emerging world fit its existing model.

This is the conch paradox at institutional scale. The protective adaptation becomes the primary constraint. The shell that enabled success prevents the transformation necessary for survival in changing conditions.

### The Unanswered Question

My colleague's message kept returning to me: "So who is going to step in to fill the void?"

If the post-World War II multilateral system is failing, if the World Bank and similar institutions are too rigid to transform, if nation states are retreating from global cooperation even as global challenges intensify—what comes next?

Perhaps the question itself reveals the constraint. We keep asking who will "fill the void" left by failing institutions, as if the solution must be another institutional shell with similar structure and assumptions. We imagine reformed multilateralism, improved governance, better leadership—variations on the existing model.

But maybe the void isn't meant to be filled by a single institutional form. Maybe transformation requires accepting that the era of centralized, US-anchored, efficiency-optimized multilateral institutions is ending not because of temporary political disruption but because the conditions that made that model viable have fundamentally changed.

Regional institutions, local capacity, diverse funding sources, flexible networks instead of rigid hierarchies, adaptive capacity instead of operational efficiency—these might not be inferior substitutes for the World Bank model. They might be necessary adaptations to a world that no longer supports the concentration of development finance and expertise in Washington-based institutions.

The small island states I study can't afford to wait for multilateral institutions to reform. They're already building alternative networks, regional cooperation mechanisms, local resilience capacity. Not because it's optimal—it's not—but because it's necessary.

The World Bank's struggle illuminates something larger than institutional reorganization. It reveals what happens when systems optimized for one era confront the end of that era. The response—strengthening existing structures, eliminating flexibility, sacrificing the capacity to question institutional assumptions—is comprehensible. It may even be inevitable given the incentives and path dependencies involved.

But it's not transformation. It's the institutional equivalent of the conch building a stronger shell as the ocean warms around it.

The question isn't who will fill the void left by failing multilateralism. The question is whether we can build the adaptive capacity to transform these institutions before they collapse entirely—or whether, like the conch, we'll perfect our protective shells until the moment they can no longer protect anything at all.
