## Chapter 9: The Regeneration Process

## Learning to heal while still broken

The transition from the intensive care unit to what the hospital called the "transition unit" marked a milestone we had been anticipating for weeks. Neo was medically stable enough to leave constant supervision, and we celebrated this progress with the relief of parents who had watched their son survive six surgeries in his first five weeks of life. Yet the moment we entered that new room, a different kind of vulnerability emerged.

"Congratulations," the nurse said with a knowing smile, "now the real work begins."

She wasn't being facetious. In the ICU, Neo had been surrounded by professionals who monitored every breath, adjusted every setting, intervened at the first sign of distress. The transition unit operated on a different philosophy: parents needed to learn medical care while their child was still fragile, developing competencies they'd never imagined needing while the stakes remained impossibly high.

We had to learn to shower a baby connected to oxygen tubes, master the intricacies of feeding through a nasogastric tube, interpret saturation monitor readings that still triggered anxiety with every fluctuation. "Hello, this is not our first child," I found myself thinking during some of the more patronizing explanations, "some things are fairly obvious." Yet we knew this process was necessary. We genuinely wanted to acquire every skill that would help Neo.

Lay and I joked that we should receive a diploma for all the knowledge we were accumulating. Beyond what the hospital taught us, we spent hours researching online, validating information with staff, learning to distinguish between normal variations and genuine concerns. It felt ironic that we were gaining all this specialized medical knowledge that we hoped never to use again—a bittersweet expertise born of crisis.

Yet even in this shared learning, we approached it differently. I tracked every metric obsessively, creating spreadsheets that charted his progress like a corporate performance review—oxygen saturation levels climbing from the low 80s to the mid-90s, feeding volumes increasing from 10ml to 60ml per session, weight gain measured in precious grams.

Lay tracked different numbers—the number of times he spit up after feeding, the minutes he could tolerate without the feeding tube, the subtle changes in his breathing patterns that only she seemed to notice. We were both data-driven, both analytical, but we were analyzing different datasets, looking for different patterns.

"We did it," Lay said one night, watching Neo breathe without the ventilator. "We actually did it."

"He's not out of danger yet. The transition home will require—"

"Can you just... can we just celebrate for one moment? Without analyzing what comes next?"

I wanted to explain that planning was how I managed anxiety, that connecting with other families had taught me what to expect. But Lay hadn't built those connections. While I'd gathered information from every parent willing to share, she'd remained more focused, trusting medical staff and her own observations.

This experience of learning new capacities while still vulnerable mirrors what I observe in Small Island States recovering from major disruptions. Communities must develop new economic activities, governance structures, or social systems while their traditional foundations remain shaken. Like us in the transition unit, they cannot wait for full restoration before beginning to build adaptive capacity.

## The battle for independence

Nothing prepared us for the epic struggle of weaning Neo from the feeding tube. What we assumed would be a straightforward medical milestone became a months-long negotiation that revealed fundamental differences between institutional priorities and parental goals.

The medical system's objective was clear: ensure adequate nutrition for growth and survival. The feeding tube guaranteed precise caloric intake, eliminated variables, minimized risks. From their perspective, weaning represented a luxury secondary to these essential functions. "His weight is not sufficient yet," we heard repeatedly. "He doesn't have reserves to push him to go oral. You would risk a regression."

But for us, the feeding tube represented something more than nutritional security—it was a barrier to normal family life and a constraint on our ability to return home to Aruba. We couldn't imagine bringing a child with a feeding tube to an island where the specialized support services we relied on in the Netherlands simply didn't exist.

Lay became our family's champion for this cause, tracking every milliliter of oral intake in detailed spreadsheets, negotiating with dietitians, researching successful weaning strategies online. She even used ChatGPT to develop feeding schedules that balanced adequate nutrition with creating enough hunger stimulus to encourage oral feeding. Every bottle became charged with hope and frustration as we measured progress in milliliters.

By the time Lay started her weaning spreadsheet, Neo had been on formula for months. My milk logistics role had long ended. Now I watched her build her case for getting him off the feeding tube entirely, tracking oral intake against weight gain, finding patterns the medical team couldn't see.

"Remember when you used to transport all that breast milk on your bicycle?" she said one evening, looking up from her data.

"In the snow. With bags hanging from both handles."

"You looked insane." She almost smiled. "But you never missed a delivery."

"We were a good team," I said.

"Were," she repeated quietly, returning to her spreadsheet.

The first attempt came after weeks of advocacy. The medical team grudgingly agreed to a one-week trial period. The pressure was enormous—every feeding session felt like a test we couldn't afford to fail. When Neo's weight stagnated and he contracted the flu, the tube went back in. Failure felt devastating, but only temporarily.

Soon after, Neo yanked the tube out himself—a small act of rebellion that we chose to interpret as readiness for another attempt. This time, with Lay's hard-won expertise and perhaps better timing, it worked. Watching Neo maintain weight while feeding orally represented victory in a battle we had been told was premature.

The irony wasn't lost on me: the Netherlands provided excellent support for maintaining feeding tube dependence—nurses would come to replace tubes, equipment was provided free of charge—but offered virtually no assistance for achieving independence from it. Parents had to fight for the transition to normal feeding, advocating against medical caution that prioritized safety over development.

## The queen conch's repair mechanisms

In nature, the queen conch possesses remarkable regenerative abilities that offer insights into recovery processes. When its shell is damaged by predator attacks, the conch can repair the breaks, often making the shell stronger at the point of injury. This biological recovery process involves redirecting energy from growth and reproduction toward healing, creating temporary vulnerability while building long-term strength.

The conch's repair process is not restoration but transformation. The repaired shell bears permanent marks of the damage, often with thicker layers and altered structure where healing occurred. The organism that emerges is not the same conch that entered the crisis—it carries both the scars and the enhanced protection that come from surviving trauma.

Similarly, Neo's medical journey involved multiple repair processes that left him stronger but permanently changed. Each surgery addressed immediate threats while creating new adaptations. The ECMO procedure that saved his life required sacrificing one of the main arteries to his head—a permanent alteration that doctors assured us would not affect his quality of life but would forever mark his anatomy as different from children who never faced such threats.

For Small Island States, post-disaster recovery follows similar patterns. Hurricane-damaged infrastructure gets rebuilt with stronger materials and better designs, but the process consumes resources that might otherwise support growth and development. The community that emerges carries both visible and invisible marks of its survival—enhanced building codes, new social networks, altered economic patterns, and collective memory of shared vulnerability.

## Preparing for discharge

As Neo's condition stabilized and discharge became a real possibility, the hospital's family support team increased their involvement. A social worker began appearing regularly, asking questions about our living situation, our support network in Aruba, our plans for ongoing care. At first, I appreciated the thoroughness. Then I began noticing a pattern.

"And the father... he's present in the home?" the social worker asked during one session, directing the question to Lay as if I weren't sitting right there.

"He's sitting next to me," Lay replied, her tone carefully neutral.

The questions continued, each one seemingly designed to assess whether I was a reliable presence in my son's life. How often was I at the hospital? Did I participate in care activities? Would I be available after discharge?

I understood that child welfare concerns were legitimate, that hospitals had protocols for identifying at-risk situations. But the undertone of these conversations felt unmistakably racialized. A white Dutch father would not have faced such scrutiny. The assumption that a Caribbean man might be an unreliable parent permeated every interaction with this particular social worker.

Rather than confronting the bias directly—which might have escalated into something that could affect Neo's care or our discharge timeline—I chose strategic compliance. I made sure to be visibly present during her visits, to demonstrate competence in every care task, to answer her questions with patience I didn't feel. It was another form of the protection calculus we had learned to navigate: absorb the indignity to secure the outcome.

## Multiple timescales of healing

Recovery from major disruption unfolds across multiple timescales that rarely align neatly. Neo's medical milestones—moving from ECMO to breathing assistance to independent breathing—followed one timeline. His weight gain and feeding development followed another. Our emotional processing of the trauma followed yet another, often lagging months behind physical improvements.

I would find myself suddenly tearful weeks after a crisis had passed, the delayed emotional response finally catching up with events my analytical mind had processed but my heart had not. Lay experienced similar delays, moments of overwhelming anxiety emerging long after the immediate dangers had resolved.

This temporal mismatch creates challenges for both families and communities recovering from crisis. External observers—insurance adjusters, development agencies, visiting relatives—often judge recovery by the most visible indicators. If the child is breathing independently, if the infrastructure is rebuilt, if GDP has returned to pre-crisis levels, then surely recovery is complete.

But the invisible dimensions of healing—the psychological scars, the altered relationships, the permanent changes in how we perceive risk and safety—operate on much longer timescales. True recovery metrics must account for these hidden dimensions, recognizing that apparent restoration may mask ongoing fragility.

## Islands in permanent recovery

For Small Island Developing States, the concept of "recovery" itself may be misleading. Many islands exist in a state of permanent recovery, facing recurring shocks that overlap and compound before full healing from previous disruptions can occur.

Consider the Caribbean experience: a major hurricane strikes, and before reconstruction is complete, another hurricane season arrives. Economic recovery from one crisis is interrupted by the next. Communities develop a kind of perpetual adaptation, never fully recovering from any single event but developing sophisticated capacities for managing ongoing disruption.

This pattern challenges the linear models of crisis and recovery that dominate both medical and development thinking. The assumption that there is a "normal" state to return to may be fundamentally flawed for systems facing chronic rather than acute threats. Instead, resilience may require accepting that some level of disruption is permanent, and building systems that can function effectively within ongoing uncertainty.

Our family was learning this lesson in real time. Even as Neo's health improved, we recognized that we would never return to the family we had been before his diagnosis. The question was not whether we could recover our previous life, but whether we could build something sustainable within our new reality.

## Transformative reconstruction

The fit-to-fly test loomed on our calendar like a final exam we had been studying for all year. Dutch medical regulations required certification that Neo could safely handle the atmospheric pressure changes of commercial flight before we could return to Aruba. Everything we had worked toward—the feeding tube weaning, the oxygen independence, the weight gain—culminated in this single assessment.

We passed. Neo's lungs, strengthened by months of careful rehabilitation, could handle the pressure differentials. His feeding, won through Lay's determined advocacy, was stable enough for the journey. His weight, painstakingly accumulated milliliter by milliliter, provided adequate reserves for travel stress.

But passing the test felt less like victory than like permission to begin something new. We weren't returning to our old life in Aruba—we were bringing a transformed family to a place that had no idea how much we had changed.

During those final weeks before our flight, as we sorted through months of accumulated medical supplies and baby equipment, Amelie began making requests about what she wanted when we returned home.

"Dad, when we get back to Aruba, I want us to get backyard chickens again so we have fresh eggs at home," she said repeatedly, her voice carrying the weight of a child who had spent a year displaced from everything familiar.

I promised her we would. Her request carried more weight than she knew—it wasn't just about eggs, but about reclaiming the rhythms and rituals that had defined our family before everything changed. Not returning to who we had been, but honoring our children's need for continuity within our transformed reality.

## The warning I didn't hear

But that evening, after the celebration had faded and Amelie was asleep, Lay grew quiet. I was practically bouncing around our cramped apartment, already imagining walking barefoot in our yard, sleeping in our own bed, reclaiming the comfortable life we had left behind more than a year earlier.

"I'm worried," she said finally, watching me.

"Worried? We passed! We're going home."

"I know." She paused, choosing her words carefully. "But what if we go back and fall into the same old patterns as before?"

Her words landed like cold water on my euphoria. Here I was, finally able to envision our return to paradise, and she was introducing doubt into what should have been pure celebration.

"Of course not," I reassured her, perhaps too quickly. "We're changed people now. We've been through too much together to go backwards."

She didn't argue. But I could see she wasn't convinced. She kept returning to this theme over our final weeks in Rotterdam—mixed feelings about a return that should have been purely joyful.

I chose to focus on the practical excitement of going home rather than engaging with her deeper concerns. That choice, in retrospect, was perhaps the first sign that I was already beginning to retreat from the emotional work our relationship required.

## What we learned

The conch's biological wisdom reminds us that true regeneration creates something both stronger and different from what existed before. The shell repairs are visible, permanent modifications that enhance protection while marking survival. Communities and families that emerge from crisis carry similar marks—scars that tell stories of survival, adaptations that provide new strength, and wisdom that comes only from navigating uncertainty.

Our family's regeneration process taught us that healing is neither linear nor complete. It is the ongoing work of living fully within transformed circumstances, using hard-won knowledge to build better responses to future challenges, and finding meaning in the journey rather than seeking a return to an idealized past.

The regeneration process had taught us that healing creates something both stronger and different from what existed before. But perhaps the most profound challenge wasn't recovering from crisis—it was maintaining the wisdom we had gained during it.

Lay had sensed this before I could. Her question hung in the air of our Rotterdam apartment, unanswered: _What if we go back and fall into the same old patterns?_

I wouldn't understand until much later that she had seen clearly what I refused to examine.
